1,1,"4. The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Budapest. 5. On 28 December 1994 the predecessor of the second applicant, represented by the first applicant, filed an action for damages against a company before the Budapest Regional Court. On 17 October 1995 the Regional Court ordered intermission of the proceedings for six months at the joint request of the parties. On 11 April 1996 the plaintiff requested continuation of the proceedings and extended its action to involve another respondent. 6. On 6 March 1997 the Regional Court delivered a judgment dismissing the action. 7. On appeal, on 17 November 1997 the Supreme Court's appellate bench quashed the first instance judgment and remitted the case to the Regional Court. 8. On 31 August 1998 the plaintiff extended the action to include a claim of invalidity of a contract. On 10 November 1998 the plaintiff stated its intention to extend the action to involve further respondents including a company based in Japan. It was therefore instructed to advance the costs of translation but complied with this order only on 4 November 1999. 9. On 20 April 2000 the Regional Court held a hearing and delivered a judgment dismissing the action. The plaintiff appealed on 5 June 2000. 10. On 27 September 2000 the plaintiff was struck out of the register of companies and ceased to exist as a legal entity. Its successor was the second applicant. However, neither itself nor its attorney, the first applicant, informed the courts or the parties of this fact. 11. On 24 September 2001 the Supreme Court quashed the first instance judgment for deficient facts and remitted the case. 12. In the resumed proceedings, a respondent notified the Regional Court on 22 May 2002 that the plaintiff had been struck out of the register of companies. On 23 May 2002 the first applicant, representing the second one, declared that he could not make a statement on the legal succession of his client. He was ordered to do so within 15 days. On 17 July 2002 he informed the court that, by way of a deed of cession, the successor of the plaintiff was his own mother, a pensioner eligible for exemption from court fees. 13. At the hearing of 26 September 2002 the first applicant produced a contract of 2 January 1996 by which part of the claims of the original plaintiff had been ceded to himself. He also submitted another document of 31 October 1998 by which he had further ceded some of those claims to his mother. He stated that he wished to enter the proceedings as party. 14. On 15 October 2002 the Head of the Economic College of the Budapest Regional Court informed the President of the Budapest Bar Association of the first applicant's conduct, deemed profoundly unethical. The applicant was subsequently reprimanded. 15. On 9 September 2003 the parties were heard as to the first applicant's claim to become a plaintiff. On 7 October 2003 the first applicant was granted leave to become a plaintiff in the proceedings. However, on the respondents' appeal against the leave, the Budapest Court of Appeal quashed the order on 1 June 2004. 16. On 13 July 2004 the Budapest Regional Court declared interruption of the proceedings on the ground that the plaintiff had ceased to exist. On 30 May 2005 the court quashed this order finding that the second applicant was the legal successor. On 28 June 2005 the first applicant stated that he did not wish to become a party to the proceedings. However, on 23 February 2006 he stated that he nevertheless joined the proceedings. 17. On the same date the Budapest Regional Court delivered a judgment dismissing the applicants' action. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held a hearing on 5 December 2006 and delivered a judgment on 13 December 2006 upholding in essence the first-instance. 18. On 12 November 2007 the Supreme Court delivered a judgment dismissing the applicants' petition for review and upholding the judgment of the Budapest Court of Appeal.",1,672

8,8,"“On the night of 19 November 1999, I was tricked into opening the door as they said that they were Osman and Şefik, my brothers-in-law. The three people who entered the house said they were from the anti-terrorism branch and they pulled my headscarf over my mouth. They were carrying Kalashnikovs. They asked for my daughter and said they were going to kill me and my children...One of them spoke Kurdish and said that he was from Urfa. The one who was tall and thin, with white skin and black hair, strangled me with an iron cord. One of them, who I cannot describe, took off my baggy trousers and pants. I fainted from shame and fear when the other inserted a truncheon into my sexual organ... When I woke up they were searching the house. They found money underneath the bed and took it with them... When my son arrived he took me to a private doctor. This doctor did not draw up a report but gave me medicine and an injection. As I was not getting better he took me to the doctors at the Human Rights [foundation]... These same three people came to my house on 27 December 1999 and said that it was not good that I had complained about them...they called their superior and a police patrol came to pick us up. My son Teyfik was next to me... At the police station, an officer named Erkan was nice to us... I was sent to the hospital. The doctor said, without examining me, that there was nothing wrong with me. After this date I was not harassed.” 30. A description of the relevant domestic law at the material time can be found in Batı and Others v. Turkey (nos. 33097/96 and 57834/00, §§ 96100, 3 June 2004).",1,302
15,15,"The applicant is a Turkish national, born in 1926 and living in Antalya (Turkey) and Belvue (Switzerland). He is represented before the Court by Mr Sinan Aklar, a lawyer practising in Antalya(Turkey). A. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant owns a three-story house on a hill overlooking the south coast of Antalya. At the time when he had his house built, the south coast was officially designated a conservation area (doğal sit alanı). According to the local master building and settlement plan (imar planı), no building was authorised in this area. In 1993 the Antalya Municipal Board revised the master plan in order to allow homes to be built. Subsequently, property developers were given building permits (inşaat ruhsatı) and undertook major building works in the area. As a result, the natural panorama of the south coast began to change rapidly. In 1993 the applicant twice complained to the Antalya City Municipality requesting that development be halted with immediate effect. In reply, the Antalya City Municipality informed the applicant that the master plan had been revised on 4 March and 2 July 1993 and that several developers had been granted construction permits pursuant to the revision. The applicant challenged the award of the building permits before the Antalya Administrative Court (İdare Mahkemesi). He contended that the revision of the master plan did not comply with the requirements prescribed by Law no. 3194 and that the presence of the buildings would deprive him of his right to the peaceful enjoyment of the panoramic view from his house. He further contended that the preservation of the natural beauty of the site was in “the public interest” and the planned high buildings did not meet safety requirements for geographical reasons. He requested the annulment of the building permits awarded to the developers. He also requested the court to order the administration to suspend (yürütmenin durdurulması) the building permits pending the outcome of the court’s final decision on the matter. On 3 February and 22 August 1994 the court ordered the administration to stay the execution of the building permits. These decisions were served on the administration on 17 February and 5 September 1994 respectively. The court noted that any further construction carried out on the basis of the permits could give rise to irreparable harm. On 27 September 1994 and 21 February 1995 the applicant’s lawyer requested the Muratpaşa Municipality and the Antalya Metropolitan Municipality to comply with the order. The municipalities neither suspended the building permits nor prevented the holders from continuing to build. Experts appointed by the court (bilirkişi) investigated the area and submitted a report which generally bore out the applicant’s allegations. On 19 November 1994 the Antalya Administrative Court found, inter alia, that the revision of the local master construction and settlement plan was not in accordance with relevant law and was not in the public interest (kamu yararı). The court also found that building permits did not comply with the revised master plan. The court accordingly annulled the revision of the master plan as well as all building permits awarded on the basis of the revised plan. The Antalya Metropolitan Municipality and the Muratpaşa Municipality appealed (temyiz) on the ground that the judgment was contrary to substantive and procedural law. On 29 May 1995 the 6th Chamber of the Supreme Administrative Court (Danıştay) upheld the judgment of 19 November 1994 of the Antalya Administrative Court. The Antalya Metropolitan Municipality and the Muratpaşa Municipality requested the rectification of the judgment (karar düzeltme) of the 6th Chamber. The request was rejected on 18 September 1996. De facto construction continued in the area even after the annulment of the building permits had become final. The applicant, with reference to the final court judgment, requested the Muratpaşa Municipality and Antalya Metropolitan Municipality to stop the building being carried out by the holders of the annulled permits and to demolish the existing buildings in the area. The municipalities failed to comply with the request. The applicant then complained to various State institutions inter alia, the Antalya Public Prosecutor’s Office, the Antalya Governor’s Office, the Ministry of Interior, and the State Ministry responsible for urban issues. He did not receive any clear response. The impugned buildings remain to this day. B. Relevant domestic law Article 138 of the Constitution provides in its fourth paragraph (unofficial translation): “Legislative and executive organs and the administration shall comply with court decisions. These organs and the administration shall neither alter them in any respect nor delay their execution.” Article 28 of the Administrative Procedure Code states (unofficial translation): “The administration shall comply with the decisions of the Supreme Administrative Court, district administrative courts, administrative and tax courts. The administration shall ensure the execution of such decisions within thirty days from the date of their notification.”",0,807
16,16,"The applicant, Ms Jozefína Beňačková, is a Slovakian national, who was born in 1912 and lives in Bánovce nad Bebravou. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. On 28 November 1997 the applicant filed a claim for damages with the Topoľčany District Court. She claimed compensation under the State Liability Act of 1969 on the ground that the sum of 3,091 Slovakian korunas (SKK) had been unlawfully withheld from her old-age pension between 20 February 1996 and 1 July 1997. The applicant relied on a decision of 30 April 1997, delivered by the Nitra Regional Court, according to which the decision to withhold a part of the applicant’s pension with a view to recovering a sum of money due by her had been erroneous. The applicant appointed her daughter to represent her in the proceedings. On 25 February 1998 the Ministry of Justice proposed in writing that the court take relevant evidence and decide on its basis. On 11 March 1998 the applicant submitted further arguments to the District Court. On 9 October 1998 the Topoľčany District Court adjourned the case with a view to hearing a representative of the defendant and studying the case-file concerning the withholding of the sum in question. On 22 December 1998 and on 16 April 1999 the president of the Topoľčany District Court dismissed the applicant’s complaints about the length of the proceedings. The applicant was informed that the case could not be proceeded with as the relevant case-file was being examined by the Trenčín Regional Court in the context of a different set of proceedings. The applicant objected that her case could be proceeded with as she had submitted all relevant information and evidence. On 13 October 1999 the president of the Topoľčany District Court informed the applicant that the examination of the case-file concerning the enforcement in question was necessary before proceeding with the applicant’s action, and that that case file was still with the Trenčín Regional Court. On 25 February 2000 the Bratislava II District Court heard the representative of the defendant Ministry at the request of the Topoľčany District Court. The representative of the defendant stated that the Ministry had no objection to the applicant’s claim being granted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the State Liability Act of 1969. On 21 March 2000 the Topoľčany District Court ordered the defendant to pay SKK 1,377 to the applicant in compensation for damage which she had suffered as a result of the above erroneous enforcement. The damages granted comprised the statutory default interest in respect of the sum which had been withheld between 20 February 1996 and 1 July 1997 and the expenses incurred by the applicant in the context of the enforcement. The court noted that the sum erroneously withheld had already been returned to the applicant. The Topoľčany District Court further granted SKK 381 to the applicant in compensation for her representative’s travelling costs and other expenses incurred in the context of the proceedings concerning her claim for damages. The District Court dismissed the applicant’s claim for compensation for the time which her representative had spent travelling to the court hearings. The decision stated, with reference to Regulation No. 240/1990, that such compensation was only payable to advocates. The judgment became final on 19 April 2000. Section 1 (1) of Act No. 58/1969 on the liability of the State for damage caused by a State organ’s decision or by its erroneous official action (“the State Liability Act”) provides that the State is liable for damage caused by unlawful decisions delivered by a public authority in the context of, inter alia, civil proceedings. In accordance with the courts’ practice, the State Liability Act does not permit granting compensation for damage of non-pecuniary nature with the exception of compensation for damage caused to a person’s health which is governed by Regulation No. 32/1965. Regulation No. 240/1990 governs the payment of advocates’ fees and expenses. Section 20 provides that advocates are entitled to compensation for travel time outside the place of their residence in the context of representing their clients.",0,687
18,18,"6. The applicant, Mr Krzysztof Bartosinski, is a Polish national who was born in 1972 and lives in Lubianka. 7. By a decision of the Bydgoszcz District Court of 14 September 2002 the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody on suspicion of illegal production and sale of alcohol, selling cigarettes without payment of excise duty and membership of an organised criminal group. According to the applicant's submissions, police officers used force against him during his arrest and insulted him. When ordering his detention, the court found that the evidence obtained in the case, in particular the testimonies of the other suspects and of a witness, bills, minutes of searches and telephone conversations, indicated a high probability that the applicant had committed the offences. The applicant's detention was therefore necessary in order to prevent collusion and to avert the risk that he would exert pressure on witnesses or that the suspects would coordinate their testimonies. 8. During the investigation the applicant's detention was successively prolonged by detention orders issued by the Inowrocław District Court or the Gdańsk Court of Appeal and dated 11 December 2002, 11 March and 27 August 2003. 9. The applicant submits that the decision of 11 December 2002 was served on him on 16 December 2002 and that for 4 days he had been kept in custody without having been provided with a relevant detention order. 10. In his letter of 3 April 2003 the Bydgoszcz Regional Prosecutor admitted that the service of the applicant's motion for release had been delayed for 5 days before reaching the Prosecutor Office. 11. In further letters, the Regional Prosecutor stated among other things that the applicant's correspondence with the prosecutor had not been delayed by the Prosecutor Office. On 15 May 2003, following the applicant's complaint to the Ombudsman about delays in the service of official letters, the President of the Inowrocław District Court clarified that the applicant's letter to the Regional Prosecutor of 27 January 2003 had been forwarded to the prosecutor on 14 February 2003 and that a letter dated 13 February had been served on the applicant on 28 February 2003. 12. The applicant submitted an envelope containing a letter from the Court, bearing several stamps of the Police Detention Centre dated 8 and 16 March 2004 including a stamp “censored” (“ocenzurowano”) with an illegible date. 13. By a decision of 14 August 2003 the Bydgoszcz Regional Prosecutor granted the applicant permission to receive a visit from members of his family in the presence of an officer of the Central Investigation Office. The prosecutor stated that the applicant had previously been granted two visits, on 28 February and 10 June 2003, and that neither the family nor the applicant had requested more frequent meetings. On 29 September 2003 the Regional Prosecutor replied to the applicant that further visits had not been granted since no requests for such had been made. 14. On 29 March 2004 the applicant was released from detention. The proceedings are pending. 15. The legal provisions governing monitoring of detainees' correspondence applicable at the material time are set out in a judgment delivered by the Court on 6 December 2005 (Wasilewski v. Poland, no. 63905/00, §§ 16-21)",1,534
19,19,"6. The applicant was born in 1945 and lives in Lubin. 7. In 1973 he had a car accident. 8. On 28 February 1977 the Lubin District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) granted the applicant a life disability pension payable by the insurer, Polish Insurance Establishment (Polski Zakład Ubezpieczeń), in the amount of 1,000 old Polish zlotys a month. 9. The insurer did not pay the applicant’s disability pension for the years 1995 to 2000. Following a complaint by the applicant in 2000, the insurer paid him the amount of 30.94 Polish zlotys (PLN), which at the relevant time was the equivalent of 7.50 euros. The applicant unsuccessfully requested several times that his pension be index linked. 10. On 30 September 2004 the applicant lodged a civil claim against the insurer. He sought the indexed pension for the years 1995-2000. The value of his claim amounted to PLN 30,480. 11. On 15 October 2004 the applicant requested the court to exempt him from the court fee. 12. On 20 November 2004 he rectified the procedural shortcomings of his request. He submitted a declaration of means, pursuant to Article 113 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Kodeks Postępowania Cywilnego). The relevant part of that declaration read as follows: “I am married. My wife receives a disability pension of PLN 500 a month. I receive a disability pension of PLN 1,300 a month. We have our three biological grandchildren, to whom we are foster parents, to support. The grandchildren are 3, 8 and 18 years of age and the oldest grandchild is still at school. Our constant monthly expenses are: - rent – PLN 320, - water – PLN 100, - electricity – PLN 120, - gas – PLN 70, - television – PLN 80, - telephone – PLN 90, -medicaments – PLN 120. I do not have any shares or securities or any savings. I do not have a car or any other property of financial value. In my opinion payment of the court fees will entail a substantial reduction in my and my family’s standard of living.” 13. On 4 December 2004 the applicant completed his declaration of means submitting that he received a disability pension of PLN 1, 383.33, his wife received a disability pension of PLN 537.93 and as foster family for their three grandchildren they received a financial benefit of PLN 2,049.40. 14. On 14 December 2004 the applicant was granted an exemption from court fees exceeding the amount of PLN 1,200 for his claim. The entire fee amounted to PLN 2,233.60. The applicant did not appeal against that decision and paid the required amount. 15. On 5 May 2005 the Legnica Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) gave judgment, dismissing the applicant’s claim for compensation. 16. On 17 June 2005 the applicant appealed against the first-instance judgment. 17. On 1 July 2005 he requested an exemption from the court fees in the appellate proceedings. The fees amounted to PLN 2,234. 18. On 12 July 2005 the Legnica Regional Court granted him an exemption from court fees exceeding PLN 1,000. 19. On 12 July 2005 the applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal (zażalenie) against that decision. 20. On 27 July 2005 the Wrocław Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) dismissed his appeal. The relevant part of the Court of Appeal’s reasoning read as follows: “The Court found that, although the income received by the applicant and his wife was not high, they should, however, when lodging an appeal, have been aware that they would have to pay the court fee, and should have made the necessary savings in advance. The court’s view could not be altered by the fact that the applicant and his wife were a foster family for their 3 grandchildren. A party seeking his or her claim in a court should limit other expenses.” 21. On 28 September 2005 the Legnica Regional Court discontinued the appellate proceedings. 22. The legal provisions applicable at the material time and questions of practice are set out in paragraphs 23-33 of the judgment delivered by the Court on 19 June 2001 in the case of Kreuz v. Poland (no. 28249/95, ECHR 2001-VI; see also the judgment delivered by the Court on 26 July 2005 in the case of Jedamski and Jedamska v. Poland, no. 73547/01, §§ 29-39).",0,715
25,25,"The applicant, Mr László Járfás, is a Hungarian national who was born in 1945 and lives in Budapest. He is represented before the Court by Mr I. Barbalics, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr L. Höltzl, Agent, Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 16 February 1993 the applicant brought an action against his employer before the Veszprém Labour Court requesting compensation in the amount of 4,000,000 Hungarian forints (HUF) (approximately 15,800 euros (EUR)) for non-pecuniary damage and an additional monthly allowance of HUF 35,000 (approximately EUR 140) for pecuniary damage. The Veszprém Labour Court transferred the case to the Veszprém County Regional Court, because in the meantime the defendant company had gone into liquidation and the Regional Court was the competent authority to deal with the issue. The initial date of the liquidation procedure was 28 December 1991. On 25 September 1997 the Regional Court, after having held three hearings and obtained the opinion of a forensic medical expert, dismissed the applicant's claims. On appeal, the Supreme Court, acting as a second-instance court, quashed the first-instance decision and remitted the case to the Regional Court on 4 January 1999. Subsequently, the applicant raised his claims again. After having held nine hearings, the Regional Court delivered a decision on 16 July 2002. It partly found for the applicant and ruled that HUF 17,270,958 (approximately EUR 68,400), and an additional HUF 231,670 (approximately EUR 900) had to be registered on the applicant's behalf as a creditor's claim (hitelezői igény) in the liquidation procedure. On appeal, the Supreme Court, acting as a second-instance court, upheld this decision on 4 October 2004. On 23 December 2004 the applicant lodged a petition for review with the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court returned the applicant's motion for completion, observing that it did not meet the minimum requirements of a petition for review in that it failed to indicate a relevant breach of law or contain a clear request to have the final decision changed. It required the applicant to resubmit an amended petition in order that an examination of at least the admissibility thereof could be carried out. However, the applicant failed to comply with the Supreme Court's supplementation order. On 19 January 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant's petition for review as inadmissible, since it was incomplete. The applicant lodged a complaint against this decision. On 5 April 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant's complaint as incompatible ratione materiae with the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. It pointed out that, in accordance with those provisions, no appeal whatsoever lay against inadmissibility decisions of the Supreme Court. In December 2004 the debtor began to transfer the sum awarded into the applicant's bank account in instalments. The last instalment was paid in June 2005.",0,486
26,26,"9. The applicant, a Swiss citizen born in 1945, resides in Minusio, Switzerland. 10. On 20 September 1994, the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody on urgent suspicion (dringender Verdacht) of having participated together with the “Carlos” terrorist group in an attack on the radio station Radio Free Europe in Munich and in attacks on diplomatic staff in Lebanon and France. The warrant of arrest also referred to a danger of collusion and absconding. 11. On 22 September 1994 the investigating judge of the Canton of Bern confirmed the detention on remand of the applicant. The decision noted that the suspicion was based on files of the East German State security authorities and the Hungarian intelligence service. There was an urgent suspicion that, as a supporter of the “Carlos” group, he had participated in the various events. Additional investigations would be necessary since the applicant refused to comment on his contacts with the group. According to the decision, detention was further required in order to avoid collusion with other members of the group. There was also a danger of absconding in view of the severity of the possible prison sentence. 12. The investigations were then conducted by the Federal Attorney’s Office (Bundesanwaltschaft). 13. On Friday, 21 October 1994, the applicant filed a request with the Federal Attorney for release from detention. He contested the urgent suspicion that he had committed the offences at issue and that there was a danger of collusion and absconding. He also requested consultation of the case-file. The request was received by the Federal Attorney on Monday, 24 October. 14. On Tuesday, 25 October 1994, the Federal Attorney dismissed the applicant’s request. The decision, referring to various investigations still to be undertaken as well as a danger of collusion and absconding, was served on the applicant on Thursday, 27 October. 15. On Monday 31 October 1994, the applicant filed an appeal (Beschwerde) against the decision of 25 October with the Indictment Chamber (Anklagekammer) of the Federal Court, invoking Article 5 §§ 1, 2 and 4 and Article 6 § 3 of the Convention and requesting release from detention. He complained that more than six weeks had lapsed without the lawfulness of his detention having been examined by a court within the meaning of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, and that he had not been able to consult the case file. The appeal was received by the Federal Court on Tuesday 1 November 1994. 16. On the same day the President of the Indictment Chamber transmitted a copy of the appeal to the Federal Attorney who was requested to submit her observations by Monday 7 November 1994. The Federal Attorney was further asked to send a copy of her observations to the applicant who, in turn, was requested to submit any observations by 11 November 1994. 17. On 7 November 1994, the Federal Attorney’s Office filed her observations. They were served on the applicant on 8 November 1994. 18. The applicant filed his observations in reply on Friday 11 November 1994. These observations were received by the Federal Court on Monday 14 November. 19. On Monday 21 November 1994, the Indictment Chamber of the Federal Court dismissed the applicant’s request, the decision being served on the applicant on Tuesday 22 November 1994. 20. In respect of the applicant’s complaint that he could not consult the case-file, the Indictment Chamber found that the applicant had had knowledge of the essential documents. The decision further confirmed that there was sufficient suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences at issue and that there was also a danger of absconding and of collusion. 21. On 30 November 1994 the Federal Attorney’s Office decided to release the applicant from detention on remand. The decision stated, inter alia, that the original suspicions directed against the applicant had not been confirmed (erhärtet). 22. According to Section 52 of the Federal Act on Criminal Procedure (Bundesstrafrechtspflegegesetz), a person detained on remand may at any time file a request for release from detention. If the investigating judge or the Federal Attorney refuse the request, an appeal may be filed with the Indictment Chamber of the Federal Court. According to Sections 105 bis and 217 of the Act, the time-limit for filing the appeal is three days.",1,714
31,31,"The applicant, Grüner Klub im Rathaus, is the fraction of an Austrian party to the Vienna Regional Parliament (Landtag). It was represented before the Court by Mrs M. Windhager, a lawyer practising in Vienna. The respondent Government were represented by Mr F. Trauttmansdorff, Head of the International law Department at the Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In the autumn of 2000 a police officer, Mr Kleindienst, revealed that he and some colleagues had repeatedly transmitted data from the central police computer to officials of the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ). Subsequently criminal investigations were opened against several persons. In the autumn of 2002 the Vienna Regional Court (Landesgericht) convicted Mr Kleindienst and the FPÖ official Mr Kreiβl and sentenced them to six months’ imprisonment suspended on probation. This judgment was later, in February 2004, quashed upon appeal and Mr Kleindienst and Mr Kreiβl were acquitted. In the meantime, after the first instance judgment, the applicant issued, on 17 September 2002, a press release which read as follows: “Member of the Green Party to the police information scandal:”[A] gift and [a] shame.” Maria Vassilakou: Austria desperately needs a new Minister of Justice Vienna (Member of the Green Party): “A shame. This judgment quite clearly bears the hallmark of Kreiβl’s fellow party member, the Minister of Justice, Böhmdorfer” so [says] the Green Member of the City Council Maria Vassilakou in view of the low [sentences of the] judgments against Kleindienst and Kreiβl. “If one considers the genesis of this incredible police information scandal, one has to wonder very much that after a dozen of suspects, month-long investigations and a long trial only this [judgment] remains.” Vassilakou concludes: “An embarrassing judgment which lets down the persons who have been spied upon and opens the floodgates for further abuse of personal data by ‘political engaged’ or simply ‘currupt’ executive officers” [Grüne zu Spitzelaffäre:”Geschenk und Schande” Maria Vassilakou: Österreich braucht dringend neuen Justizminister.

Dieses Urteil trägt ganz klar die Handschrift von Kreiβels Parteifreund Justizminister Böhmdorfer”, so die Grüne Stadträtin Maria Vassilakou in Anbetracht der geringen Urteile gegen Kreiβl und Kleindienst. “Betrachtet man die Genesis dieser unglaublichen Spitzelaffäre wundert man sich schon sehr, wenn von mehreren Dutzend Verdächtigen, monatelangen Untersuchungen und ein langwieriger Prozess lediglich dies übrig bleibt.” Vassilakou abschlieβend: “Ein peinliches Urteil, das die bespitzelten Personen im Regen stehen lässt und Tür und Tor für weiteren Missbrauch von vertraulichen Personendaten durch ‘politisch engagierte’ oder schlicht ‘käufliche’ Exekutivbeamten öffnet”] Mr Böhmdorfer subsequently brought proceedings under section 6 of the Media Act (Mediengesetz) with the Vienna Regional Court (Landesgericht für Strafsachen). On 28 November 2002 the Regional Court, having held on oral hearing, found that the statement “A shame. This judgment quite clearly bears the hallmark of Kreiβl’s fellow party member, the Minister of Justice, Böhmdorfer” amounted to defamation within the meaning of Articles 111 and 297 of the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch). It ordered the applicant under section 6 of the Media Act to pay compensation to Mr Böhmdorfer in the amount of 3,000 euros (EUR). It further ordered it to publish the judgment. The court noted that the impugned statement read in its context suggested that Mr Böhmdorfer had abused his authority as Minister of Justice to influence the deciding court. However, the applicant had failed to prove that this had indeed been so. The applicant appealed and submitted in particular that the impugned statement amounted to a value judgment on a political issue and it was therefore, in any event, not possible to prove its veracity. Furthermore, there had been some factual basis for the statement. The applicant referred in this regard to the general political background of the “police information scandal”, the conduct of the criminal investigations and to the fact that Mr Böhmdorfer at the beginning of the investigations had refused all reproaches of illegal data consulting. The applicant finally contended that the court should have interpreted the statement in a broader sense, meaning that the judgment against Mr Kleindienst and Mr Kreiβl corresponded to Mr Böhmdorfer’s political mindset and style. On 8 September 2003 the Vienna Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It found that the impugned statement, read in its context, did not allow any other conclusion to be drawn than that Mr Böhmdorfer had unlawfully influenced the deciding judge in the criminal proceedings. However, the evidence adduced by the applicant, namely general press releases relating to the conduct of the criminal investigations in the police information case, Mr Böhmdorfer’s statements in the context of these investigations and the fact that Mr Böhmdorfer had himself been criticised for allegedly having used illegal obtained material, did not give any indication for the veracity of this allegation. The applicant’s right to freedom under expression under Article 10 of the Convention did not protect false statements of facts. Moreover, the applicant had not even given Mr Böhmdorfer the opportunity to comment. This judgment was served on the applicant’s counsel on 22 October 2003.",0,839
34,34,"The applicant, Mr Murat Arslan, is a Turkish national who was born in 1979 and is currently detained in Nazilli Prison (Turkey). He was represented before the Court by Mr E. Yildiz, a lawyer practising in Izmir. On 9 October 2001 the applicant was arrested and taken into police custody at the headquarters of the anti-terrorism branch of the Izmir security police. On 12 October 2001, after being interviewed by the public prosecutor at the Izmir National Security Court, he was taken before a judge of that court who on 13 October 2001 ordered his detention pending trial. On 19 October 2001 the public prosecutor committed the applicant for trial in the National Security Court. The criminal proceedings against the applicant are still pending. The applicant’s lawyer dated his application 12 April 2002 and took it on 19 April to the post office in Konak (central Izmir), where post is collected regularly several times a day.",0,156
36,36,"The details of the applicants are contained in the annex. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent; and in those cases in which they were intervening party, the Republic of Cyprus were represented by their Agent. The facts of the cases, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows. The applicants submitted that since the 1974 Turkish intervention in northern Cyprus they have been deprived of their property rights, as their property was located in the area that was under the occupation and control of the Turkish military authorities. Since that date, they had been prevented from having access to and from using their respective homes and properties. In particular: The first applicant, mother of the second and third applicants (born in 1951 and 1949 respectively) was married to Michael Fieros, who by 1974 was a leading property developer in the Kyrenia area, owning over 200 sites on many of which he had built villas and luxury flats as well as the family home. On his death in 1983, his property passed to the applicants. In or about 1995, the second applicant donated her share in the property to the second and third applicants. The second applicant is the father of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth applicants, born in 1925, 1959, 1960, 1961 and 1967 respectively. The third to sixth applicants are shareholders in the first applicant, a company set up in 1968, which dealt in real estate. The fifth and sixth applicants are director and secretary, and director, respectively of the first applicant. The first applicant owned various houses, shops, warehouses and plots of land. This property included the house built on plot 150 which was where the other applicants were living in 1974 and had been living since 1968. The applicant owned a half share in immovable property in Dherynia, near to Famagusta, consisting of some 11 acres of orange groves. He had married in April 1968 and from July 1971 had been living with his wife and two children in a house which belonged to his wife. The applicants are a family, consisting of a father, mother and three children (born in 1958, 1960 and 1969 respectively). The first applicant owned, or part owned, some 20 plots of land in and around Famagusta, including buildings, shops, apartments, a restaurant and various land on or near the seafront as well as the family home. The third, fourth and fifth applicants each owned varying shares in thirteen plots of land. The second applicant owned half of two plots, one co-owned with the first applicant; while the third applicant wholly owned another plot of land. The applicants are a family (grandmother, uncle, father, mother, son and daughter) born in 1916, 1938, 1941, 1947, 1968 and 1970 respectively. They owned, or part-owned, 17 plots of land and four houses and various other buildings in or around Famagusta. Of the houses, two were claimed as having been family homes: a house built on plot 504 which had been the home where the second and third applicants had grown up and where the first and second applicants had been living in 1974 and which was now owned by the fifth and sixth applicants; and a house built on plot 1189 where the third, fourth, fifth and sixth applicants had been living in 1974 and which was jointly owned by the second and third applicants. The applicants are mother and daughter, born in 1928 and 1951 respectively. In 1973, the first applicant's husband died and the family home owned by him was inherited by the first applicant and her two children. In January 1974, on the second applicant's marriage, the first applicant rented an apartment pending the availability of another property under lease. In 1995, due to health reasons, the first applicant transferred her share in the family home and other properties, including houses, shops and fields to the second applicant. The applicants are a family; the third and fourth applicants born in 1933 and 1931 are the parents of the first and second applicants born in 1960 and 1959. Prior to the invasion in 1974, the third applicant had run a shop on land which had been owned by the fourth applicant. She had also owned two plots of land, on one of which was situated the family home. The applicants are a family; the first applicant is the mother of the second, third, fourth and fifth applicants, born in 1950, 1952, 1955 and 1958 respectively. Prior to events in 1974, they had lived together in the family home owned by the first applicant's husband. His property, some forty plots of land, including business premises, building plots, fields and orchards, was inherited by the applicants on his death in 1981. The first applicant however donated her share to the other applicants. The first and second applicants, husband and wife, are the parents of the third, fourth and fifth applicants who were born in 1961, 1963 and 1975. The first applicant owned 29 plots of land, 2 flats and a storehouse; the second applicant owned 3 building plots, 3 buildings and 2 flats; both appear to have jointly owned the family apartment. The third, fourth and fifth applicants also owned property, including a flat and various plots of building land. The applicant family, now living in Australia, consist of the first and second applicants, husband and wife, and their two children, the third and fourth applicants, born in 1967 and 1968. The first applicant was part owner of the family house, as well sharing ownership of a plot of land with the second applicant.",0,936
37,37,"1. The Dudgeon case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (""the Commission"") in July 1980. The case originated in an application against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission on 22 May 1976 by a United Kingdom citizen, Mr. Jeffrey Dudgeon. 2. On 30 January 1981, the Chamber constituted to hear the case relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the plenary Court (Rule 48 of the Rules of Court). By judgment of 22 October 1981, the plenary Court held, inter alia, that the applicant had been the victim of a breach of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention by reason of the existence in Northern Ireland of laws which had the effect of making certain homosexual acts committed in private between consenting adult males criminal offences (Series A no. 45, point 1 of the operative provisions and paragraphs 37-63 of the reasons, pp. 27 and 17-25). The only outstanding matter to be settled in the present case is the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50). Accordingly, as regards the facts the Court will confine itself here to giving the pertinent details; for further particulars, reference should be made to paragraphs 13 to 33 of the above-mentioned judgment (ibid., pp. 7-16). 3. At the hearing held on 23 April 1981, counsel for the applicant had stated that, should the Court find a violation of the Convention, his client would be seeking just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) to obtain financial compensation for damage suffered and for legal and other expenses incurred. The Government of the United Kingdom (""the Government""), for their part, had taken no stand on the matter. In its judgment of 22 October 1981, the Court reserved the whole of the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) and referred it back to the Chamber under Rule 50 § 4 of the Rules of Court. On the same day, the Chamber invited the Commission to submit, within the coming two months, written observations thereon, including notification of any friendly settlement at which the Government and the applicant might have arrived (ibid., p. 48). 4. Following two extensions by the President of the Chamber of the above-mentioned time-limit and in accordance with his orders and directions, the following documents were filed at the registry: - on 17 May 1982, the observations of the Delegates of the Commission, appended to which were, inter alia, details of the applicant's claim; - on 6 August 1982, a memorial from the Government; - on 15 September 1982, the reply of the Delegates to a question raised therein by the Government; - on 15 October 1982, through the Secretary to the Commission, the observations of the applicant on the above-mentioned memorial of the Government; - on 15 November 1982, the comments of the Government on the latter observations. On 8 November 1982 and 11 January 1983, the Secretariat of the Commission transmitted to the Registrar further observations by Mr. Dudgeon, which the latter had sent to the Commission on his own initiative. These various documents revealed that it had not been possible to arrive at a friendly settlement. The Delegates did not comment on the merits of the applicant's claim, which may be summarised as follows: - for damage suffered as a result of the police investigation carried out in 1976, financial compensation of £5,000; - for damage suffered by reason of the very existence of the legislation successfully complained of, financial compensation of £10,000 and a declaration by the Government that if Mr. Dudgeon were to apply for civil service employment he would not be discriminated against either on grounds of homosexuality or for having lodged his petition with the Commission; - reimbursement of costs itemised at £4,655. Further particulars of the claim are set out below in the section ""As to the law"". 5. Following the Court's judgment of 22 October 1981 and on the initiative of the Government, an Order in Council, entitled the Homosexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 1982, was made. Subject to certain exceptions concerning mental patients, members of the armed forces and merchant seamen, the effect of this Order, which came into force on 9 December 1982, is to ""decriminalise"" in Northern Ireland homosexual acts committed in private between two consenting males aged 21 years and over. The Order brings the relevant law in Northern Ireland into line with that applying in the remainder of the United Kingdom (see the above-mentioned judgment of 22 October 1981, pp. 9-10, §§ 16-18). 6. Having consulted, through the Registrar, the Agent of the Government and the Delegates of the Commission, the Chamber decided on 1 October 1982 that there was no call to hold hearings. 7. Mr. J. Cremona, Mr. F. Matscher and Mr. B. Walsh, substitute judges, took the place of Mr. Thór Vilhjálmsson, Mr. G. Lagergren and Mr. L. Liesch, who were prevented from taking part in the further consideration of the case (Rules 22 § 1 and 24 § 1 of the Rules of Court).",0,844
46,46,"8. Mr Manlio Vendittelli, an architect, lives in Rome. 9. On 19 May 1986 the Rome municipal police (vigili urbani) sealed his flat, on the ground that he had infringed the town-planning regulations. 10. On 20 May 1986 the Rome magistrate (pretore) confirmed the sequestration (sequestro) and criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant. Mr Vendittelli lodged three applications for release of his property from sequestration on 30 May 1986 and 5 and 26 June 1987 but they were dismissed on 12 June 1986 and 9 July 1987 for reasons of prevention and of preservation of evidence (per fini preventivi e cautelari). 11. On 25 July 1987 the applicant sought an early hearing, pointing to the damage caused him by his being unable to enjoy the benefit of his property. The trial was initially set down for 17 November 1987 but was postponed to 15 December 1987. In a judgment delivered the same day, which was filed in the registry on 30 December 1987 and notified on 1 December 1988, the magistrate imposed on Mr Vendittelli, who was present when the judgment was delivered, a suspended sentence of twenty days’ imprisonment and a fine of ten million lire, without any entry in the criminal records, for having carried out works in his flat without a permit from the mayor (concessione edilizia). 12. The applicant appealed against this decision within three days of its delivery and filed his pleadings on 10 December 1988; the twenty-day period allowed for filing grounds of appeal began to run on the day of service of the judgment. The hearing in the Rome Court of Appeal began on 2 May 1989. It was adjourned on 8 January and 27 March 1990 - on the first occasion at the request of Mr Vendittelli, whose doctor had ordered him to rest for five days, and on the second occasion because his counsel was unable to attend. In the meantime, on 13 January 1990, the lawyer had already applied for the trial to be resumed. 13. In a judgment of 4 July 1990, which was filed in the registry on the same day and became final and therefore enforceable on 30 October 1990, the Court of Appeal held that the offence had been amnestied and the prosecution barred as a result of a presidential decree that had been issued on 12 April 1990. It did not, however, order that the property should be released from sequestration, nor was the judgment notified to the applicant, who had to obtain a copy from the registry on 5 December 1990. In the meantime, by a letter of 19 July 1990, Mr Vendittelli had applied for a hearing to be fixed. 14. On 19 November 1990 the file was sent to the magistrate for placing in the archives. In a letter of 10 December 1990 to the President of the Rome Court of Appeal, which was sent on 17 December to the magistrate’s court (pretura), the applicant again sought to have his property released from sequestration. He complained of the bad state of his flat. 15. On 17 December the registrar of the magistrate’s court sent the file to the magistrate for execution of the judgment, that is to say release from sequestration. On 31 January 1991 the magistrate held that he had no jurisdiction and ordered that the file should be returned to the Court of Appeal. 16. It arrived the next day. The central registry of the Court of Appeal recorded the point raised regarding execution (incidente di esecuzione) and on 11 February 1991 sent the file to the registry of the Second Criminal Division. On 10 April and 9 May 1991 Mr Vendittelli again sought to have his property released from sequestration. 17. In an order of 17 May 1991, which was filed on 21 May, sent to Rome Town Hall on 23 May ""for execution of what was ordered in it"" and served on the applicant on 3 June, the Rome Court of Appeal allowed Mr Vendittelli’s application and also noted that the mayor had issued a permit in the meantime.",0,682
47,47,"1. The applicants are Cypriot nationals. Their names, dates of birth and places of residence are set out in the Annex. They are represented by Mr Christos M. Triantafyllides, Mr Andreas Angelides, Mr Achilleas Demetriades, Mr Achilles Emilianides, Mr Christos Clerides, Ms Kallistheni Demetriou Stivarou, Mr Constantinos Tambourlas and Mr Loukis Loucaides, lawyers practising in Cyprus. 2. The facts of the case may be summarised as follows. 3. The applicants stated that they are relatives of 29 Greek-Cypriot men, both civilians and army personnel, who went missing in July-August 1974 following the invasion of northern Cyprus by Turkish armed forces. These men were listed as missing persons, the information being given to the Red Cross and the United Nations. 4. The respondent Government stated that the relatives of Christakis Contementiotis had already known that he had died at the time of the events in 1974 but that his body could not be recovered due to the conflict. They pointed out that his name was not submitted to the authorities as one of the men who had gone missing. 5. The remains of the missing men have been found during exhumations carried out by the United Nations Committee for Missing Persons (“CMP”) between 20059. Further details are set out in the Annex. 6. On 19 March 2011 the lawyer for the applicants in the group of applications ((nos. 7048/08, 4584/10, 5281/08, 4649/10, 5189/10, 6081/10, 7839/10, 4852/05 and 5210/08) landed from Athens at Istanbul international airport for a two-day business and private trip as he had done before. At passport control, he was held up for two hours and then confined to the airport terminal. In the afternoon, after seven hours, his passport was returned and he was put on a plane back to Athens. He was questioned by the Greek police on arrival as the Turkish authorities had described him to the airline and Greek authorities as “unwanted”.",0,317
48,48,"The applicant is a Turkish national, born in 1960 and living in Batman. He is represented in the proceedings before the Court by Mr Mesut Bektaş, and Mrs Meral Bektaş, lawyers practising in Diyarbakır. The applicant was detained for interrogation on 18 January 1981. On 12 March 1983 the Diyarbakır Martial Court ordered his formal arrest. On 23 September 1988, the Diyarbakır Martial Court found the applicant guilty of membership of the PKK, involvement in the bombing of a junior officer’s house and attempted murder. The court sentenced him to sixteen years and eight months’ imprisonment. The court ordered the applicant’s conditional release. On 10 February 1991 the Military Court of Cassation upheld the lower court’s judgment. Meanwhile, on 4 October 1990 the applicant was detained for the second time and on 18 October 1990 was formally arrested. On 17 March 1993 the Diyarbakır State Security Court No. 2 found the applicant guilty of separatist acts and sentenced him to life imprisonment. On 5 November 1993 the Court of Cassation upheld the Diyarbakır State Security Court’s judgment. On 13 February 1998 the applicant requested the Diyarbakır State Security Court No. 2 to sentence him on the basis of the principle of multiplicity of sentences. On 20 March 1998 the Diyarbakır State Security Court No. 2 accepted the applicant’s submissions. The Diyarbakır State Security Court No. 2 sent its final decision to the Bursa Public Prosecutor’s Office in order to have its decision of 20 March 1998 executed. On 27 March 1998 the Office of the Bursa Public Prosecutor objected to the decision to apply to the applicant the principle of multiplicity of sentences and requested the Diyarbakır Public Prosecutor’s Office to contest the decision or, alternatively, to forward its objection to the Diyarbakır State Security Court. On 1 April 1998 the Diyarbakır Public Prosecutor sent the correspondence of the Office of the Bursa Public Prosecutor to the Diyarbakır State Security Court No. 3. On 1 April 1998 the Diyarbakır State Security Court No. 3 accepted the objections of the Bursa Public Prosecutor’s Office and cancelled the earlier decision on multiplicity of sentences. The Diyarbakır State Security Court No. 3 concluded that the multiplicity of sentences principle was only to be applied in circumstances where a person is convicted of several crimes. As regards the applicant, the court found that he had no right to invoke the multiplicity of sentences principle since his first sentence in respect of which he was conditionally released had already been executed. The court relied on Law no. 647 which provides that if a person is conditionally released his sentence is considered to have been executed.",0,440
52,52,"The applicant, Mr Martti Leino, is a Finnish national who was born in 1937 and lives in Espoo. He was represented before the Court by Mr P. Kavonius, a lawyer practising in Lohja. The respondent Government were represented by their agent, Mr Arto Kosonen of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The applicant had a voluntary pension insurance from 1988 until 2001 into which he paid in total 16,902.72 euros (EUR). From April 2001 his employer was responsible for paying contributions to the insurance policy and in November 2001 it paid one instalment of EUR 4,940.25. By a decision of 20 August 2002 the Social Insurance Institution (kansaneläkelaitos - KELA, folkpensionsanstalten – FPA, hereafter “KELA”) granted the applicant an old-age pension (kansaneläke, folkspension) of EUR 154.85 per month as from 1 October 2002. The occupational pension (työeläke, arbetspension) paid to the applicant by a life insurance company was taken into consideration in calculating the amount of his old-age pension. On 5 June 2003 an insurance company granted the applicant a pension based on his voluntary pension insurance retroactively as from 1 October 2002. As a result of this new pension decision the KELA informed the applicant by letter of 10 June 2003 that there had been an error in the previous decision of 20 August 2002 and that his old-age pension would diminish as a result of the pending rectification. The applicant was invited to inform the KELA of his opinion on the rectification by 30 June 2003. A form to this effect was attached to the letter. The applicant did not reply to the letter. On 30 June 2003 the KELA made a decision to cease the payment of the applicant’s old-age pension as of 1 July 2003 due to the increase in his other pensions. The applicant did not appeal against this decision which thus became final. By a letter dated 1 July 2003 the KELA informed the applicant that the old-age pension he had received in the period between 1 October 2002 and 30 June 2003, in total EUR 1,404.81, was in fact in excess due to the new calculations and that he should let the KELA know his opinion on the matter by 12 July 2003. The applicant did not reply to the letter. On 22 August 2003 the KELA decided to recover the entire old-age pension paid. The applicant was given two months to pay. On 17 September 2003 the applicant appealed to the Appellate Board for Social Insurance (tarkastuslautakunta, prövningsnämnden) against the decision of 22 August 2003. He claimed that the entire voluntary pension was regarded by the KELA as one paid by his employer whereas he himself, the tax authorities and his insurance company considered the main part of that pension as being paid by the applicant. On 26 August 2004 the Appellate Board dismissed his appeal, stating that there were no reasons for making an exception to the rule that pension payments to which the recipient was not entitled should be paid back. On 13 October 2004 the applicant appealed to the Insurance Court, which dismissed his appeal on 23 February 2006 without elaborating on the reasons or addressing the specific circumstances of the applicant’s pension. On 17 March 2006 the KELA requested the applicant to contact them regarding the schedule of repayments. Subsequently the insurance company’s lawyer contacted the KELA and provided additional clarifications, to no avail. On 11 May 2006 a payment order was sent to the applicant.",0,577
55,55,"The applicant is a public company “The Urals Factory of Heavy Engineering” (Открытое акционерное общество «Уральский завод тяжелого машиностроения», AO “Uralmash” or “the applicant company”) located in Yekaterinburg. The applicant company is represented before the Court by Ms I. Krivykh, the head of its legal department. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant company, may be summarised as follows. Pursuant to decisions of the Sverdlovsk Regional Committee for Management of the State Property of 6 and 25 November 1992, the applicant company was privatised and the assets of the serial devices engineering plant (Завод серийных машин, “the Plant”) were included, among others, in the applicant company’s charter capital. On 9 December 1994 the applicant company made an offer to the Government to return the Plant into state ownership in exchange for a certain number of the applicant company’s shares. On 6 September 1995 the Government accepted the offer and the terms and conditions of the exchange were developed at a meeting on 17 October 1995. On 11 June 1996 the applicant company and the Government signed an agreement on the transfer of the Plant to the State for consideration. On the same day the applicant company transferred the Plant to the State Committee for Management of the State Property of the Russian Federation, acting on behalf of the Government. On 3 October 1997 the applicant company invited the Government to pay the stipulated consideration for the Plant. On 19 January and 2 February 1998 the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation and the Government acknowledged the outstanding debt and offered to pledge the respective amount in the next year’s State budget. However, on 27 November and 29 December 2000 the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation refused to pay the applicant company with reference to the absence of supporting documentation. On 2 February 2001 the applicant company lodged a civil action against the Government and the Ministry of Finance with the Moscow Commercial Court (Арбитражный суд г. Москвы). The applicant company sought to recover the outstanding payment for the transferred Plant. On 23 May 2001 the Moscow Commercial Court dismissed the applicant company’s action. The court held that the Plant had been unlawfully privatised and, therefore, it could not be legitimately transferred back into state ownership for consideration. On 13 June 2001 the applicant company brought an appeal (апелляционная жалоба) against the judgment of 23 May 2001. It argued, inter alia, that the privatisation had been lawful and subsequently approved by a Government resolution. On 17 August 2001 the Appeal Instance of the Moscow Commercial Court (апелляционная инстанция Арбитражного суда г. Москвы) granted the applicant company’s action and awarded it RUR 204,363,814.33 to be paid by the Ministry of Finance on behalf of the Russian Federation. On 11 and 17 September 2001 the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry for State Property brought cassation appeals (кассационные жалобы) against the judgment of 17 August 2001. On 24 October 2001 the Federal Commercial Court of the Moscow Circuit (Федеральный арбитражный суд Московского округа) granted the cassation appeals, quashed the judgment of 17 August and restored the judgment of 23 May 2001. The applicant company sent several applications for supervisory review (заявление о принесении протеста в порядке надзора). These applications were refused by letters of the deputy President of the Supreme Commercial Court of the Russian Federation of 27 April and 13 June 2002 and a letter of the President of the Supreme Commercial Court of the Russian Federation of 31 October 2002. On 9 January 2003 the applicant company lodged an application for supervisory review under the new procedure, in force as of 1 January 2003. On 31 January 2003 the application for supervisory review was dismissed. The applicant company was advised that, under the new procedure, no new applications on the same subject were permissible. On 1 September 2002 the new Code on Commercial Procedure of the Russian Federation (Арбитражный процессуальный кодекс РФ) entered into force, with the exception of Chapter 36 of the Code “Proceedings for the review of courts’ decisions by way of supervision” (“Производство по пересмотру судебных актов в порядке надзора”) which became effective as of 1 January 2003. Chapter 36 established a new procedure for the supervisory review of courts’ decisions that have already entered into legal force. According to a general rule in Article 292 § 3 of the Code on Commercial Procedure, the application for supervisory review can be filed with the Supreme Commercial Court of the Russian Federation within three months after the contested decision entered into legal force, provided that all other remedies have been exhausted. The Law on the Introduction of the Code on Commercial Procedure of the Russian Federation of 24 July 2002 (Федеральный закон «О введении в действие Арбитражного процессуального кодекса РФ» № 96-ФЗ) provided that, in respect of courts’ decisions made before 1 January 2003, the period for filing an application for supervisory review of such decisions will be calculated from 1 January 2003.",0,830
56,56,"The applicant, Zeina Hajj Hussein, was born in 1965 and claims to be Lebanese. However, the Swedish authorities found that she had not made it probable that she originates from Lebanon and therefore held that her case should be tried not only against Lebanon but also against the neighbouring countries Turkey and Syria. In 2006, the applicant had a relationship with a man who turned out to be a drug addict and dealer. After her parents banned her from seeing him, he started to harass her and threatened to kill her. Her brother also threatened to kill her due to that relationship. On 7 May 2009 the Migration Board rejected her asylum application as it found the alleged incident to be an act of criminality which was for the domestic authorities to handle. The applicant had neither turned to those authorities for protection nor made it probable that they could not provide protection against the threats in question. The Board therefore held that, should the applicant be victim of further crimes upon return, she could seek protection from the authorities in Lebanon, Syria or Turkey. On 22 November 2010 the Migration Court upheld the decision of the Board. As stated by herself in the present application, the applicant did not appeal against the Migration Court’s judgment to the Migration Court of Appeal. With the rejection of the applicant’s asylum application she has no right to remain in Sweden and can be removed without further proceedings. The provisions applicable in the present case are laid down in the Aliens Act (Utlänningslagen, 2005:716). The Act defines, inter alia, the conditions under which an alien can be deported or expelled from Sweden as well as the procedures relating to the enforcement of such decisions. The Act stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is, with certain exceptions, entitled to a residence permit in Sweden (Chapter 5, section 1). The term “refugee” refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race, nationality, religious or political beliefs, or on grounds of gender, sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country (Chapter 4, section 1). This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities cannot be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals. By “an alien otherwise in need of protection” is meant, inter alia, a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well-founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment, or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Chapter 4, section 2). As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order, account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement, an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Chapter 12, section 1). In addition, an alien must not, in principle, be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution (Chapter 12, section 2). Under certain conditions, an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force. This is the case where new circumstances give reasonable grounds for believing, inter alia, that an enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or where there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced (Chapter 12, section 18). If a residence permit cannot be granted under these rules, the Migration Board may instead decide to re-examine the matter. Such a re-examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed, on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien, that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in Chapter 12, sections 1 and 2, and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not having done so. Should the applicable conditions not be met, the Migration Board shall decide not to grant a re-examination (Chapter 12, section 19). Matters concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in Sweden are dealt with by three instances: the Migration Board, the Migration Court and the Migration Court of Appeal. The applicants are entitled to be represented before these bodies by publicly-appointed counsel (Chapter 14, section 3, Chapter 16, section 9, and Chapter 18, section 1). The time-limit for appeals to the final instance is three weeks from the date of the appealed judgment (Chapter 16, section 10). For a case to be considered by the Migration Court of Appeal, leave to appeal is required and will be granted if there are special reasons for hearing the appeal or if the determination of the Migration Court of Appeal may be of importance as a precedent. If leave to appeal is granted, the Migration Court of Appeal can decide the case on the merits (Chapter 16, section 12).",0,936
64,64,"4. The applicant, Mr Józef Gidel, is a Polish national, who was born in 1959 and lives in Kraków, Poland. 5. The applicant runs a car repair shop in Kraków. On 11 March 1993 he sued a certain I.K. and the State Treasury before the Kraków District Court (Sąd Rejonowy), seeking payment for the repair of I.K’s car. On 27 August 1993 the statement of claim was served on I.K who, at that time, lived in Germany. 6. The first hearing was set down for 21 December 1993 but was later adjourned because the presiding judge was ill. The court held hearings on 26 April, 26 August, 4 November 1994 and on 21 March 1995. 7. Subsequently, the defendant challenged the impartiality of all the judges of the Kraków District Court. On 8 November 1995 the Kraków Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) dismissed his challenge, finding that it lacked any basis and that the relevant statutory requirements for the disqualification of the judges were not satisfied. His further appeal was dismissed by the Kraków Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) on 30 January 1996. 8. On 23 October, 1 December 1995 and on 13 May 1996 the applicant sent letters to the court asking for a hearing date to be fixed as soon as possible. 9. On 30 August 1996 the court ordered an expert to prepare a report. However, the expert failed to comply with the court’s order. On 21 October 1996 the court ordered yet another expert to prepare a report within one month. It was submitted to the court on 17 December 1996. 10. On 28 March 1997 the applicant again asked the court to fix a date for a hearing. 11. On 12 December 1997 the court held a hearing. 12. At the hearing held on 3 April 1998 the court ordered that the claim against the State Treasury be examined separately. The next hearing, scheduled for 12 May 1998, was cancelled as there was no courtroom available. 13. On 1 April 1998 I.K. challenged the impartiality of the presiding judge. On 1 June 1998 a panel of three judges, sitting as the Kraków District Court, dismissed the defendant’s challenge, ruling that it was totally unsubstantiated. The court also imposed a fine on him, holding that the challenge had been made in bad faith. His further appeal was dismissed by the Kraków Regional Court on 10 February 1999. 14. On 26 June 1998 the Kraków District Court gave an interlocutory judgment. It dismissed the applicant’s claim against the State Treasury on the ground that its liability had not been established. 15. Meanwhile, the defendant had informed the trial court that he had moved to Poland. This resulted in Kraków-Śródmieście District Court no longer having territorial jurisdiction over the case. On an unknown date the applicant was asked to indicate in which court he wished to pursue his claim: Kraków-Podgórze District Court or Kraków-Nowa Huta District Court. The applicant failed to do so. On 12 July 2000, of the court’s own motion, the case was referred to the Kraków-Podgórze District Court. 16. On 16 October 2000 the applicant sent a letter to the President of the Kraków Regional Court. He complained about the slow conduct of the proceedings. On 17 November 2000, in reply to his complaints, the President observed that the proceedings were indeed lengthy and gave his assurance that he would supervise their conduct. 17. At the hearing held on 9 February 2001 the Kraków District Court gave judgment. On 27 April 2001 the applicant appealed. On 15 October 2001 the Kraków District Court rejected the appeal, as the applicant had failed to pay the required court fee within the statutory time-limit. On 30 January 2002 the Kraków Regional Court quashed this decision and allowed the applicant’s appeal of 27 April 2001. 18. The proceedings are pending before the Kraków Regional Court.",1,645
70,70,"1. The applicant, Ms Henryka Ostrowska, is a Polish national, who was born in 1956 and lives in Mielec. 2. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz, succeeded by Ms J. Chrzanowska, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. On 11 July 2001 the applicant filed an application with the Rzeszów Social Security Board (Zakład Ubezpieczeń Społecznych) (“SSB”) to be granted the right to an early-retirement pension for persons raising children who, due to the seriousness of their health condition, required constant care, the so-called “EWK” pension. 5. On 1 August 2001 the Rzeszów Social Security Board issued a decision granting the applicant the right to an earlyretirement pension in the net amount of 521 Polish zlotys (PLN). 6. On 30 September 2002 the Rzeszów Social Security Board issued simultaneously two decisions in respect of the applicant. By virtue of one decision, the payment of the applicant’s pension was discontinued with immediate effect. By virtue of the other decision, the Board reopened the proceedings, revoked the initial decision granting a pension and eventually refused to grant the applicant the right to an early-retirement pension under the scheme provided for by the 1989 Ordinance. 7. The applicant appealed against the respective decisions divesting her of the right to an early-retirement pension. 8. On 3 December 2003 the Tarnobrzeg Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) dismissed the appeal. 9. The applicant further appealed against the first-instance judgment. 10. On 19 May 2004 the Rzeszów Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) dismissed the appeal. This decision was served on the applicant on 22 June 2004. 11. Some 130 applications arising from a similar fact pattern have been brought to the Court. The majority of the applicants form the Association of Victims of the SSB (Stowarzyszenie Osób Poszkodowanych przez ZUS) (“the Association”), an organisation monitoring the practices of the Social Security Board in Poland, in particular in the Podkarpacki region. 12. Out of all applications lodged with the Court, about twenty-four applicants decided not to lodge a cassation appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal given in their case. 13. One hundred-and-four applicants lodged cassation appeals against the final judgments given in their cases. The Supreme Court entertained and dismissed on the merits fifteen appeals. In eighty-one applications the Supreme Court refused to entertain cassation appeals on the ground that they did not raise any important legal issues or require the Supreme Court to give a new interpretation to legal provisions which raised serious doubts or gave rise to ambiguity in the jurisprudence of the domestic courts. In the remaining eight cases cassation appeals were rejected for failure to comply with various procedural requirements. 14. The legal provisions applicable at the material time and questions of practice are set out in the judgment in the case of Moskal v. Poland, no. 10373/05, § 31-34, 15 September 2009.",0,494
77,77,"The applicant is a Turkish national, born in 1970. He is currently living in Turkey. He is represented before the Court by Mr. R. Soyer, a lawyer practising in Vienna. The applicant lived in Austria with his parents and siblings since 1978. He went to school there and later on took up employment. His parents and one brother have meanwhile acquired Austrian citizenship. On 27 September 1992 the Vienna Federal Police Authority (Bundespolizeidirektion) revoked the applicant’s unlimited residence permit. It noted that the Vienna Regional Criminal Court, on 19 September 1990, had convicted the applicant of damage to property and burglary and had sentenced him to four months’ imprisonment suspended on probation. On 6 December 1991 the same court had convicted him of attempted theft and attempted intimidation and had sentenced him to three months’ imprisonment suspended on probation. In view of these convictions, both of which were final, the applicant no longer fulfilled the requirements for an unlimited residence permit. On 13 January 1993 the Vienna Federal Police Authority issued a residence ban of unlimited duration against the applicant on account of his convictions. On 14 July 1993 the Vienna Public Security Authority (Sicherheitsdirektion), upon the applicant’s appeal, quashed the residence ban against him. It relied on S. 20 § 2 of the 1992 Aliens Act (Fremdengesetz) according to which no residence ban may be issued against an alien if it would have been possible to grant him citizenship under S. 10 § 1 of the Citizenship Act, i.e. if he has been resident in Austria without interruption for ten years, before the offences in question were committed, except in case of offences punishable with more than five years’ imprisonment. On 17 June 1994 the Vienna Regional Government dismissed the applicant’s request for a residence permit. His appeal to the Federal Ministry for the Interior was to no avail. On 1 February 1995 the Vienna Federal Police Authority issued a deportation order against the applicant. It relied on S. 17 of the 1992 Aliens Act, according to which illegally resident aliens are to be ordered to leave the Federal territory. It noted that in addition to his convictions in 1990 and 1991, the applicant had been convicted of possession of illicit drugs by the Vienna District Criminal Court on 7 May 1992, without an additional sentence being passed. On 12 October 1992 the Vienna Regional Criminal Court had convicted him of making illicit drugs accessible to minors and sentenced him to three months’ imprisonment. On 3 March 1993 the Vienna Regional Criminal Court had convicted him of a number of offences including aggravated fraud, theft, assault and obstructing public authority and had sentenced him to eight months’ imprisonment. The authority acknowledged that the deportation constituted a serious interference with the applicant’s private and family life. According to S. 19 of the 1992 Aliens Act a deportation order was only to be issued if it was necessary within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the European Convention of Human Rights. Having regard to the applicant’s repeated convictions including those for drugs offences, which involved particular dangers for public safety, the public interest in deporting him outweighed his interest in remaining in Austria. On 24 April 1995 the Vienna Public Security Authority dismissed the applicant’s appeal. On 13 June 1995 the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof) refused to entertain the applicant’s complaint. Subsequently, it referred the case to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof). On 8 February 1996 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. It found that the deportation order against the applicant was necessary within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights in the interests of public safety and the prevention of crime, having regard to his prolonged illegal residence since the withdrawal of his residence permit and the gravity of the offences, in particular the drugs offences, committed by him. The decision was served on the applicant on 15 May 1996.  On 21 July 1996 the applicant left Austria and is now living in Turkey.",0,672
78,78,"1. The applicant in the first case, Mr Joseph McLean, is a British national, who was born in 1980. He was represented before the Court by Taylor & Kelly, a firm of solicitors based in Coatbridge. 2. The applicant in the second case, Mr Kevin Cole, is a Jamaican national, who was born in 1974. He was represented before the Court by Leigh Day & Co, a firm of solicitors based in London. 3. Both applicants are in detention following their conviction for various criminal offences. 4. The applicants complained that, as convicted prisoners, they had been subject to a blanket ban on voting in elections and had been, or would be, prevented from voting in one or more of the following: elections to the European Parliament on 4 June 2009; the parliamentary election on 6 May 2010; elections to the Scottish Parliament on 5 May 2011; a nationwide referendum on the alternative vote on 5 May 2011; local government elections on various dates; and future elections. 5. Pursuant to sections 1-4 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 a convicted person, during the time that he is detained in a penal institution in pursuance of his sentence, is legally incapable of voting at any parliamentary or local election. 6. Section 11 of the Scotland Act 1998 provides that only persons who, on the day of the poll, would be entitled to vote as electors at a local government election and are registered in the register of local government electors are entitled to vote as electors at an election to the Scottish Parliament. 7. Section 8(1) of the European Parliamentary Elections Act 2002 provides, in so far as relevant, that a person is entitled to vote at an election to the European Parliament if, on the day of the poll, he would be entitled to vote as an elector at a parliamentary election. 8. In so far as relevant, section 2 of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 provided that only those who, on the date of the alternative vote referendum, were entitled to vote as electors at a parliamentary election were entitled to vote in the alternative vote referendum of 5 May 2011. 9. Each of the four jurisdictions of the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) is subdivided into a number of local authorities. The specific system in place varies depending on the jurisdiction in question. 10. The system of local government was created by statute. Local authorities’ internal organisation and competences are regulated by statutes enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and by the Parliaments and Assemblies of the three devolved jurisdictions (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). 11. The functions and powers of local authorities are of a predominantly administrative nature and generally cover areas such as waste management and collection, housing, local planning, council tax collection, licensing, transport and social services. In respect of these various areas, local authorities carry out their duties in accordance with primary legislation governing the area in question and can only act in so far as they are authorised to do so by statute or by subordinate legislation. 12. Local authorities have the power to make by-laws, which are essentially laws of local application. By-laws usually have to be confirmed by a Government minister or the ministers of the devolved jurisdictions before they can take effect. 13. On 23 November 2010 the Court (Fourth Section) adopted a pilot judgment in Greens and M.T. v. the United Kingdom, nos. 60041/08 and 60054/08, ECHR 2010 (extracts). It found a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 in respect of the blanket ban on voting applicable to convicted prisoners as regards parliamentary elections and elections to the European Parliament. It also imposed a deadline for action, indicating that the United Kingdom had to introduce legislative proposals to amend the incompatible legislation within six months of the date on which the judgment became final, with a view to the enactment of the law according to any time-scale determined by the Committee of Ministers. 14. On 22 November 2012 the Government published a draft bill on prisoners’ voting eligibility. The draft bill includes three proposals: (1) ban from voting those sentenced to four years or more; (2) ban from voting those sentenced to more than six months; or (3) ban from voting all prisoners. The proposals cover both local and parliamentary elections. Although the draft bill is currently drafted to extend to England and Wales only, the introduction and explanatory notes make it clear that the final bill would extend to the whole of the United Kingdom. The devolved jurisdictions are therefore involved in the pre-legislative process. 15. On 6 December 2012 the Committee of Ministers, responsible for supervising the execution of the judgment, adopted a decision in which it noted the range of options proposed in the draft bill; endorsed the view that the third option aimed at retaining the blanket ban was not compatible with the Convention; invited the Government to keep it regularly informed of the proposed time-scale; and decided to resume consideration of the case at the latest at its September 2013 meeting. 16. On 16 April 2013 a motion to nominate the six members of the House of Commons to serve on a joint committee which will conduct prelegislative scrutiny of the draft bill was agreed. On 14 May 2013 a motion to nominate the six members of the House of Lords to serve on the committee was agreed. The committee held its first meeting on 15 May 2013 and will report by 31 October 2013. 17. On 10 June 2013, there was a hearing before the Supreme Court in the case of McGeoch v. The Lord President of the Council and another. The claimant is a serving prisoner who claims that the prohibition on prisoners voting is incompatible with European Union law.",0,980
80,80,"8. The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Shipston Stour, Warwickshire. 9. Under current United Kingdom law, the state pension age is 65 for men and 60 for women. Until these ages, men and women who work are required to pay national insurance contributions (“NICs”) if their earnings are above a threshold amount, currently 385 pounds sterling (GBP) per month. 10. The applicant is over 60 years old and works as an administrator. Since he has not reached the state pension age for men of 65, he is required to pay NICs on his earnings. At the time of introduction of the application, his monthly salary was GBP 2,970 and he paid 10% of his earnings (between the primary threshold of GBP 385 and the upper earnings limit of GBP 2,535) in NICs (Class 1), amounting to GBP 215 per month and GBP 2,580 per annum. From April 2003, NICs increased to 11% of the amount up to the upper earnings limit, plus an additional 1% on all earnings above the limit. The applicant’s NICs increased to GBP 241.34 per month. 11. The applicant will be required to pay national insurance contributions from his earnings until he reaches the age of 65. 12. A woman of 60 years or more who continued to work would not be required to pay any NICs on her earnings. 13. The applicant wrote to his Member of Parliament and the Paymaster General complaining about the difference in treatment for men and women. Both replied stating that since liability to pay national insurance contributions is linked to the state pension age, the treatment of men and women would equalise in 2020 when the state pension age will equalise. 14. The National Insurance Act 1946, which first established the basis for the national social security scheme in the United Kingdom, set out a system of funding under which all employers and the majority of the working population, whether employed or self-employed, are liable to pay compulsory NICs contributions. This legislation has since been replaced, most recently, by the consolidating provisions of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (“SSCBA 1992”) and the Social Security Administration Act 1992. 15. Section 1(2) of the SSCBA 1992 sets out the various classes of NIC. Of these, the largest category is Class 1 contributions which consist of earnings-related contributions paid by employers and employees. Such contributions are levied as a percentage of earnings which varies according to the employee’s earnings band. The NIC scheme is financed on a “pay as you go” basis, that is, current NICs fund current benefits: thus an individual’s contributions fund not his or her own benefits but those of others (R. (Carson) v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] 3 All ER paragraphs 25-26). 16. A substantial contribution has been made to the National Health Service from NICs for many years. Following the National Insurance Act 2002, which imposed an additional deduction of 1% of earnings above the upper earnings limits, the element of calculation of the NHS allocation was also increased from 1.05% of earnings paid in the tax year to 2.05%. 17. Section 6(2) of the Act provides that only those under the state pension age are liable to pay NICs from their earnings. The state pension ages are currently set as 65 for men and 60 for women according to section 122. 18. Section 126 of the Pensions Act 1995 provides for the equalisation of state pension ages for men and women to the age of 65. The state pension age for women will increase gradually from 2010 and the equalisation will be complete in 2020. At the same time, the age until which women are liable to pay NICs will gradually increase in line with the increase in the state pension age. 19. Council Directive 79/7/EEC of 19 December 1978 provides for the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security. However, in Article 7(1)(a) the Directive provides for derogation in the matter of “the determination of pensionable age for the purposes of granting old-age and retirement pensions and the possible consequences therefore for other benefits”. 20. In the Case C-9/91 The Queen v. Secretary of State for Social Security, ex parte Equal Opportunities Commission [1992] ECR1-4297 (“the EOC case” concerning reference for a preliminary ruling from the High Court), the European Court of Justice found that: Article 7(1)a had to be interpreted as authorising the determination of a statutory pensionable age which differs according to sex for the purposes of granting old-age and retirement pensions and also forms of discrimination which are necessarily linked to that difference; Inequality between men and women with respect to the length of contribution periods required to obtain a pension constitutes such discrimination where, having regard to the financial equilibrium of the national pension system in the context in which it appears, it cannot be dissociated from a difference in pensionable age; In view of the advantages allowed to women by national pension systems, in particular as regards statutory pensionable age and length of contribution periods, and the disruption that would necessarily be caused to the equilibrium of those systems if the principle of equality between the sexes were to be applied from one day to the next in respect of those periods, the Community legislature intended to authorise the progressive implementation of that principle by the member States and that progressive nature could not be ensured if the scope of the derogation authorised by Article 7(1)a were to be interpreted restrictively.

82,82,"4. The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Kysucké Nové Mesto. He is a self-employed food products wholesaler. 5. In May 1993 an article was published in several papers about a salmonella epidemic suggesting that it had had its origin in dried milk which had been produced by the applicant. 6. On 4 August 1993 the applicant brought an action in the Čadca District Court (Okresný súd) for protection of personal integrity against four publishers, the Slovakian Press Agency, two of his business partners and a research institute. He claimed that the published information was untrue in so far as it concerned him and that it caused damage to his business interests. He sought compensation in the amount of 180,000 Slovakian korunas (SKK). 7. On 9 August 1993 the District Court held a hearing following which, on the same day, it decided to transfer the case to the Banská Bystrica Regional Court (Krajský súd) for reasons of jurisdiction. 8. On 20 October 1993 the applicant submitted correct addresses for two of the defendants. The decision to transfer the case was then served on these defendants and became final on 24 February 1994. 9. On 9 March 1994 the Regional Court requested that the applicant pay court fees which he did on 5 April 1994. 10. The Regional Court subsequently sought the defendants’ observations in reply and, on 9 May 1994, the applicant withdrew his claim in respect of one of them. 11. On 27 June 1994 the Regional Court held a hearing which was adjourned with a view to obtaining further information including a case file with the Považská Bystrica District Court in a criminal case. 12. On 21 September 1994 the applicant extended the action in that he requested that an apology be published and that he be paid SKK 1 million in damages. 13. On 29 September 1994 the Regional Court requested the applicant to pay court fees for his extended claim, which he did on 4 October 1994. 14. On 6 October 1994 the Považská Bystrica District Court requested that the above-mentioned criminal file be returned to it because it was needed in connection with a different criminal case. The Regional Court returned the case file on 10 November 1994 but requested that it be given back as soon as possible since it was still needed in connection with the applicant’s case. The Regional Court reiterated the request on 8 February 1995 and, in response, it was informed that the case file in question was in fact with the criminal division of the Regional Court on appeal in the second of the criminal cases mentioned above. 15. Between 2 June 1995 and 5 June 1996 the Regional Court held 4 hearings 3 of which were adjourned in order to obtain further evidence. On each occasion 3 or more of the defendants had been absent. 16. In the meantime, on 14 December 1995 the Regional Court decided to return a part of the court fees to the applicant on the ground that he had reduced the scope of his claim for damages to SKK 500,000. 17. On 7 June 1996 the Regional Court delivered a judgment ordering one of the defendants to pay the applicant SKK 90,000, dismissing the action in respect of four defendants and discontinuing the proceedings in respect of the remaining two defendants. 18. Both the applicant and the defendant who had been ordered to pay damages appealed on the ground that the operative part of the written judgment did not correspond to the judgment which the court had given orally. 19. On 14 November 1996 the Regional Court ordered the applicant to pay the court fees for his appeal and, on 10 February 1998, it delivered two separate decisions by which it corrected errors in the costs order and in the judgment of 7 June 1996. 20. On 23 December 1998 the Supreme Court quashed the judgment of 7 June 1996 as being incomprehensible and lacking adequate reasons, which made it impossible to review it. The Supreme Court observed that the rectification decision of 10 February 1998 had changed the substance of the contested judgment, which was procedurally impermissible. The case was remitted to the Regional Court for re-examination. 21. The applicant then withdrew the action in so far as it concerned 5 of the defendants and maintained it in respect of 2 defendants. 22. On 20 September 1999 the Regional Court held a hearing following which, on the same day, it ordered each of the remaining defendants to pay the applicant SKK 50,000 in damages and dismissed the remainder of his claim. The applicant and one of the defendants appealed. 23. On 3 May 2000 the Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s petition for an exemption from the obligation to pay court fees for his appeal. 24. On 19 December 2000 the Supreme Court quashed both the judgment of 20 September 1999 and the decision of 3 May 2000 on court fees. It held that the Regional Court had failed to give comprehensible reasons for the amount of damages to be paid to the applicant and that it had failed to establish adequately the facts relevant for the decision on court fees. 25. On 28 September 2001 and 14 January 2002 the Regional Court held hearings. Following the latter hearing, on the same day it exempted the applicant from the obligation to pay court fees, ordered one of the defendants to pay the applicant SKK 10,000 in damages and dismissed the remainder of the claim. The parties waived their right of appeal and the judgment became final and binding on 6 February 2002. 26. On 12 February 2003 the applicant complained of the length of the proceedings to the Constitutional Court (Ústavný súd) under Article 127 of the Constitution. 27. On 26 February 2003 the Constitutional Court rejected the complaint as having been lodged after the expiry of the twomonth time-limit laid down in the Constitutional Court Act.",1,996

On an unknown later date he was indicted before the Biskupiec District Court. 6. Between 19 March and 19 June 2006 the applicant was detained on remand. 7. On 3 June 2003 the District Court convicted him as charged and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment. 8. On 26 June 2003 the applicant appealed against his conviction. 9. On 16 October 2003 the Olsztyn Regional Court quashed the judgment and remitted the case. 10. Between 19 October 2005 and 29 March 2006 the District Court held seven hearings. On several occasions the applicant who was duly summoned, refused to appear at hearings. However, the court proceeded with the trial in his absence. 11. On 31 March 2006 the Biskupiec District Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment. 12. On 14 September 2006 the Olsztyn Regional Court again quashed the judgment and remitted the case. 13. On 3 June 2009 the Gizycko District Court again convicted the applicant as charged. 14. On 27 July 2009 the applicant filed his appeal against this judgment. It appears that the proceedings are pending before the Olsztyn Regional Court. 15. On 16 and 21 August 2007 the applicant lodged complaints with the Białystok Court of Appeal under the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”). The applicant sought a ruling that the length of the proceedings before the Olsztyn Regional Court had been excessive and an award of just satisfaction. 16. On 7 November 2007 the Court of Appeal gave a decision and dismissed the applicant’s complaint. 17. On 19 June 2008 the Olsztyn Regional Court dismissed yet another complaint under 2004 Act lodged by the applicant. The court considered that there had been no significant delays in the proceedings. 18. The applicant was also involved in several other sets of criminal and civil proceedings, in particular, proceedings concerning assaulting a judge and contempt of court. The proceedings were terminated respectively on 24 October 2005 and 14 March 2007 by the Olsztyn Regional Court. 19. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court’s decisions in cases of Charzyński v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), §§ 12-23, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v.

87,87,"The applicant, Mr. Esko Passila, is a Finnish national who was born in 1941 and lives in Lahti. On 5 January 2001 the Social Insurance Institution (kansaneläkelaitos, folkpensionsanstalten) of Lahti decided that as of December 1999 the Finnish social security legislation did not apply to the applicant as he was not considered to be permanently resident in Finland. The applicant appealed to the Appellate Board for Social Insurance (tarkastuslautakunta, prövningsnämnden) which rejected the appeal on 12 October 2001. The decision of the Appellate Board was sent to the applicant’s address in Estonia, but allegedly the applicant never received it. He had allegedly requested the authorities to send the decision to his address in Finland. The applicant alleged that he became aware of the decision of the Appellate Board in February 2002 when the Social Insurance Institution asked him to return some wrongly paid social benefits. By that time the decision of the Appellate Board had already gained legal force and he was not able to appeal against it to the Insurance Court (vakuutusoikeus, försäkringsdomstolen). At that time he allegedly asked advice from the Appellate Board and the Insurance Court, without any helpful response. Under section 61 of the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act (hallintolainkäyttölaki, förvaltningsprocesslagen 586/1996) an expired time-limit may be restored to a person who has a legal excuse or who for another strong reason was unable to observe a prescribed time-limit in lodging an appeal against a decision. Under section 62 of the said Act an application for the restoration of an expired time-limit shall be lodged with the Supreme Administrative Court (korkein hallinto-oikeus, högsta förvaltningsdomstolen) within one year of the expiry of the original time-limit, at the latest. For a very strong reason the time-limit may be restored even after that period. In a decision of 16 November 2001 (no 2862) the Supreme Administrative Court decided to restore an expired time-limit for A in order to lodge an appeal to the Administrative Court against a decision of the Environmental Board in a case where the decision of the Environmental Board was not given to him as required by section 54, subsection 1 of the Environmental Protection Act (ympäristönsuojelulaki, miljöskyddslagen).",0,361
88,88,"4. The applicant, Mr Antoni Puczyński, is a Polish national who was born in 1940 and lives in Kraków. 5. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 6. On 15 October 2000 the applicant lodged with the Mayor of Kraków (Urząd Miasta) an application to transform his right of perpetual use (prawo użytkowania wieczystego) of a piece of real property into a right of ownership. He relied on the provisions of the 4 September 1997 Law on Transforming Perpetual Use Vested in Individuals into Ownership (ustawa o przekształceniu prawa użytkowania wieczystego przysługującego osobom fizycznym w prawo własności) (“the 1997 Act”). 7. On 3 November 2000 the Mayor informed the applicant that, due to a judgment of the Constitutional Court (Trybunał Konstytucyjny) which found some provisions of the 1997 Act to be incompatible with the Constitution, he could not give a decision in the case within the statutory time-limit of one month, and set a new time-limit of 31 July 2001. 8. On 27 November 2001 the Mayor informed the applicant that, due to some changes to the 1997 Act, a valuation report concerning the property (operat szacunkowy) had to be drawn up and a new time-limit set, 31 March 2002. 9. On 6 August 2002 the applicant complained to the Kraków SelfGovernment Board of Appeal (Samorządowe Kolegium Odwoławcze) about inactivity on the part of the administrative authority. 10. On 17 January 2003 the Kraków Self-Government Board of Appeal found the applicant's complaint well-founded and ordered the Mayor to give a decision on the merits within one month of the delivery of its decision. 11. The Mayor did not give the decision within the prescribed timelimit. Instead, on 6 March 2003, the Mayor issued a procedural decision (postanowienie) setting another time-limit, 31 December 2003, and informing the applicant that the decision could not be appealed against and that it could be challenged only when a decision on the merits had been given. 12. On 20 August 2004 the applicant again asked the Mayor to give a decision in his case. 13. On 7 September 2004 the Mayor informed the applicant that, due to further changes to the 1997 Act, by a decision of 5 August 2004 the proceedings for transforming his right had been discontinued and that proceedings for ex lege acquisition of the property in question had been instituted. 14. On 23 December 2004 the Mayor again informed the applicant that the matter could not be resolved within the statutory time-limit and set a new time-limit of 31 December 2005. 15. On 22 June 2005 the applicant again complained to the Kraków SelfGovernment Board of Appeal about the inactivity of the administrative authority. 16. On 5 August 2005 the Kraków Self-Government Board of Appeal found the complaint justified and ordered the Mayor to give a decision in that connection within one month of the delivery of its decision. 17. On 15 September 2005 the Mayor gave a decision on the merits and refused to acknowledge an ex lege acquisition of the property by the applicant. 18. On 27 September 2005 the applicant appealed. 19. On 30 December 2005 the Kraków Self-Government Board of Appeal quashed the challenged decision and remitted the case. 20. On 11 April 2006 the Mayor gave a further decision and again refused to acknowledge an ex lege acquisition of the property. 21. On an unspecified date the applicant appealed. 22. On 19 June 2006 the Kraków Self-Government Board of Appeal again quashed the challenged decision and remitted the case. 23. On 3 November 2006 the Mayor gave a decision, again a refusal. 24. The applicant did not appeal against that decision. 25. The relevant domestic law concerning inactivity on the part of administrative authorities is set out in the Court's judgment in the case of Grabiński v. Poland, no. 43702/02, §§ 60-65, 17 October 2006.",1,647
90,90,"4. The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Ankara. 5. On 21 November 1983 the applicant was arrested and taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, the DevYol (Devrimci Yol - the Revolutionary Way). 6. On 30 December 1983 the Ankara Martial Law Court ordered the applicant’s detention on remand. 7. On 14 December 1988 the applicant was released pending trial. 8. On 19 July 1989 the Ankara Martial Law Court convicted the applicant of membership of an illegal organisation and sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment. 9. On 28 December 1996 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the Ankara Martial Law Court on the ground that the latter had misinterpreted the domestic law in respect of the offence in question. 10. Subsequent to the promulgation of Law no. 3953 on 27 December 1993, which abolished the jurisdiction of the Martial Law Courts, the Ankara Assize Court acquired jurisdiction in the applicant’s case. 11. On 6 May 1996 the Ankara Assize Court commenced the applicant’s trial. 12. On 28 May 2004 the applicant was convicted of attempting to undermine the constitutional order under Article 146 of the Criminal Code. The first-instance court however held that there was no need for the applicant’s imprisonment, taking into account his previous custody and detention on remand. 13. The proceedings are still pending.",1,228
92,92,"5. The applicant was born in 1976 and lives in Vác. 6. In January 2002 the Pest Central District Court found the applicant, a recidivist offender, guilty of attempted blackmail and plunder and sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment. On appeal, the Budapest Regional Court, on 15 May 2003, re-characterised his actions as offences of “taking the law into one’s own hands”, attempted aggravated assault and a violation of personal liberty, but reduced his sentence to five years’ imprisonment. 7. In February 2003 the applicant was charged with aggravated assault. In the ensuing proceedings the applicant was assisted by court-appointed defence counsel. 8. After holding three hearings, the Pest Central District Court found the applicant guilty as charged on 26 February 2004. The District Court took account of the protraction of the proceedings as a mitigating factor and sentenced him to four years’ imprisonment. The District Court relied on documentary evidence, the opinion of a forensic medical expert and the testimony of several witnesses as well as the applicant. 9. The applicant appealed, seeking acquittal on the ground that the judgment was ill-founded. The Budapest Regional Court notified the applicant’s lawyer that it would determine the appeal at deliberations in camera. In reply, the lawyer put forward his arguments in detail and requested the court to hold a public hearing. He asserted that the court should hear further witnesses in order to establish the facts fully. 10. On 1 February 2005 the Regional Court held deliberations in camera and upheld the applicant’s conviction. The applicant, his lawyer and the prosecution were not present. The Regional Court reviewed the entirety of the proceedings and upheld their lawfulness. Furthermore, it considered that the findings of fact by the first-instance court were not ill-founded within the meaning of section 351(2) of the New Code of Criminal Procedure, and were thus suitable for appellate review without taking further evidence. This consideration enabled the court to hold deliberations in camera, pursuant to section 360(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, without the attendance of either the defence or the prosecution. 11. Act no. XIX of 1998 on the [New] Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in so far as relevant, as follows: “... (3) An appeal may concern questions of fact or law.” “(1) The second-instance court shall base its decision on the facts as established by the first-instance court unless the first-instance judgment is ill-founded.... (2) The first-instance judgment is ill-founded if: a) the facts have not been explored; b) the first-instance court has failed to establish the facts or the findings of fact are deficient; c) the findings of fact are in contradiction with the contents of the documents; d) the first-instance court has drawn incorrect conclusions from the findings of fact in regard to a further fact.” “... (2) In order to eliminate the ill-foundedness of the first-instance judgment, evidence may be taken if the findings of fact have not been established or are deficient. Evidence shall be taken ... at a hearing.” “(1) Within 30 days of receiving the file, the president of the panel in charge shall schedule, in order to deal with an appeal, deliberations in camera (tanácsülés), a public session (nyilvános ülés) or a hearing (tárgyalás). ...” “(1) The second-instance court shall hold a public session, if – the first-instance judgment being ill-founded – the complete and/or correct findings of fact may be established from the contents of the file or through drawing factual conclusions, or if the defendant must be heard in order to clarify the circumstances relevant for imposing the sentence. (2) The second-instance court shall summon to the public session those persons whose hearing it deems necessary ...” “(1) The second-instance court shall notify the public prosecutor and – if they are not summoned – ... the defendant and his lawyer of the public session. ...” “(2) In order to take evidence, a hearing (tárgyalás) ... shall be scheduled.” “(1) The court’s final decision on the merits is susceptible to a [Supreme Court] review (felülvizsgálat) if ... c) the decision has been adopted amidst procedural irregularities within the meaning of section 373(1) subparagraphs II to IV.”",1,690
93,93,"5. The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Pécs. 6. On 6 March 2008 the applicant, at the material time a member of the Hungarian Workers’ Party 2006 (Munkáspárt 2006), a registered left-wing political party, was convicted by the Pécs District Court under section 269/B (1) of the Criminal Code of the offence of having displayed a totalitarian symbol in public. The court observed that the applicant had publicly worn a five-pointed red star while participating in a demonstration on 1 May 2004 celebrating Hungary’s accession to the European Union and, at the same time, the International Workers’ Day. As a sanction, the court issued a reprimand. 7. On appeal, on 23 September 2008 the Baranya County Regional Court reversed this judgment and acquitted the applicant. In holding that his act had represented in fact no danger to society, the Regional Court made reference inter alia to a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, adopted on 8 July 2008, which had been introduced by another individual on account of a conviction similar in nature (Vajnai v. Hungary, no. 33629/06). In that judgment the European Court of Human Rights held that prosecution for having worn a red star amounted to a violation of that applicant’s freedom of expression enshrined in Article 10 of the Convention. 8. In pursuit of the prosecution’s further appeal, on 5 March 2010 the Pécs Court of Appeal reversed the second-instance judgment and upheld the applicant’s conviction. It confirmed the reprimand and ordered the applicant to pay 7,500 Hungarian forints in criminal costs. The Court of Appeal held that positive Hungarian law did not permit the domestic courts to apply the holding of Vajnai as such. It pointed out that the conditions of social dangerousness – which had been found by the Supreme Court to be absent in some, otherwise similar, cases – were indeed present in the instant circumstances. The court argued as follows: “The common feature of those cases can be summarised as the absence of identification with the totalitarian symbol, in the first case more emphatically, and in the latter one by virtue of the perpetrator’s indifference towards the symbol connected to the incriminated conduct. The situation in the present case, however, was quite the contrary. János Fratanoló used the five-pointed red star in a political context and as a sign of solidarity felt for his fellow party member, that is, because he identified himself with the symbol, with its meaning known and communicated to the outer world. In this context, the defendant’s concrete political credo is irrelevant: the statutory provision prohibits everyone, irrespective of one’s conviction, from the use of totalitarian symbols, including the five-pointed red star associated with Communist dictatorship. This statement remains true even if the symbol in question has dual meaning referring both to the totalitarian system mentioned above and to the international workers’ movement promoting the ascendance of large groups of society. ... The entirety of the elements of this offence is defined as the legal hypothesis of a socalled “conduct” (immaterial) crime. This means that the offence will be committed merely by performing the sanctioned conduct (dissemination, use in public or public display) and no further condition or result, let alone actual fear or anxiety caused to those perceiving, is required.” The court concluded that the applicant’s act was indeed dangerous to society. 9. Act no. IV of 1978 on the Criminal Code provides: “(1) A criminal offence is an act perpetrated intentionally or – if the law also punishes negligent perpetration – by negligence, which represents a danger for society and for which the law orders the infliction of punishment. (2) An activity or omission shall be an act dangerous to society if it violates or endangers the constitutional, social or economic order of the Republic of Hungary, or the person or rights of citizens.” “(1) Any person who (a) disseminates, (b) uses in public or (c) exhibits a swastika, an SS-badge, an arrow-cross, a symbol of the sickle-and-hammer or a five-pointed red star, or a symbol depicting any of them, commits an offence – unless a more serious crime has been committed – and shall be sentenced to a fine. (2) The conduct prescribed under paragraph (1) is not punishable if it is done for the purposes of education, science, art or in order to provide information about history or contemporary events. (3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not apply to the insignia of States which are in force.”",1,747
95,95,"The applicant, Mrs Elisabeth Lamprecht, is an Austrian national who lives in Linz. She was represented before the Court by Mr H. Blum, a lawyer practising in Linz. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant introduced proceedings for the preservation of evidence (Beweissicherungsverfahren) against a building company, P. On 3 February 2000 the Linz District Court (Bezirksgericht) ordered the applicant to pay part of the defendant's costs relating to the preservation of evidence, namely 7,416.96 Austrian schillings (ATS). The defendant appealed against the costs order (Kostenrekurs). This appeal was not transmitted to the applicant. On 21 December 2000 the Linz Regional Court (Landesgericht), sitting in camera, partly granted the defendant's appeal and ordered the applicant to reimburse costs of altogether ATS 8,459.64. No main proceedings were brought, as meanwhile, in April 2000, the parties had concluded an out-of-court settlement. Under the terms of this settlement the P. company paid the applicant ATS 25,000 as compensation for damages and ATS 20,693.98 as reimbursement for cash expenses incurred in the proceedings for the preservation of evidence. Proceedings for the preservation of evidence are regulated in the Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozeßordnung). “(1) An application for evidence to be taken or for witnesses and experts to be heard can be lodged, for the purposes of securing the presentation of the evidence, at any time in the proceedings and even before the proceedings have begun if there is cause to fear that the evidence will otherwise be lost or its examination made difficult. (2) Those measures can also be ordered where the conditions of [Article 284] paragraph 1 are not satisfied if the present condition of an item of evidence is to be ascertained and the applicant has a legal interest in having it ascertained.” “(3) The party applying for the measure shall be liable for the costs of the taking of evidence without prejudice to any claim for damages on their part. The other party to the proceedings shall be reimbursed the necessary costs of his or her participation in the taking of evidence without prejudice to the decision in the main proceedings.”",0,360
99,99,"The applicant is a Finnish national, born in 1947 and living in Malaga, Spain. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. On 21 December 1993 the Helsinki Tax Office made a decision that the applicant was due to pay residual taxes since he had not announced certain income in the amount of FIM 100,000 in his tax returns. The applicant was also obliged to pay a 20% tax increase on the amount. The decision was based on a tax audit in a company called AT. This company had paid FIM 100,000 to the limited company F, which was owned by the limited partnership company SR. The applicant was the only active partner of SR, which owned 100% of the shares of F. On 20 February 1994 the applicant appealed to the County Administrative Court (lääninoikeus, länsrätten) of Uusimaa, complaining that the decision was wrong and that he had not been informed of the legal provisions on which the decision was based. The appeal was referred to the local tax rectification board (verotuksen oikaisulautakunta, prövningsnämnden i beskattningsärenden) which, on 9 May 1994, rejected the appeal. On 1 August 1994 the applicant again appealed to the County Administrative Court. On 19 January 1996 the court lowered the tax increase from 20% to 10% and upheld the remainder of the decision. The court stated that the payment of the amount of FIM 100,000 was considered to be the applicant’s personal income since he had received payment for his actions related to a sales contract concerning an airplane. The payment was considered to be the applicant’s personal income, even though he had waived his right to the amount in favour of company F. Further the court noted that, as the applicant had not announced that amount in his tax returns, the tax office had a right to order the payment of a residual tax and impose a tax increase. Finally, the court rejected, for lack of a legal basis, the applicant’s request that the taxes already paid by companies AT and F on the same ground be counted for his benefit. On 31 December 1996 the Supreme Administrative Court (korkein hallinto-oikeus, högsta förvaltningsdomstolen) refused the applicant’s request for leave to appeal. On 29 September 1994 the Execution Office collected from the applicant FIM 62,116 as residual taxes, FIM 1,863 as a payment of back taxes, additional taxes amounting to FIM 32,178, default interest of FIM 4,347 and FIM 400 as execution fee, altogether FIM 100,904 (€ 16,970). After the decision of the County Administrative Court the applicant was refunded FIM 5,093.",0,435

The applicant’s employer had taken out insurance with the insurance company ZT. 7. On 30 August 1995 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against ZT in the Celje District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Celju) seeking damages in the amount of 8,009,850 tolars (approximately 33,300 euros) for the injuries sustained. Between 1 October 1996 and 8 January 1999 the applicant lodged eight preliminary written submissions and/or adduced evidence. Between 14 November 1996 and 1 October 1998 she made six requests that a date be set for a hearing. On 25 September 1997 the judge presiding the case was appointed to the Celje Higher Court (Višje sodišče v Celju) and the case was assigned to a new first-instance court judge. Of the three hearings held between 13 December 1996 and 13 January 1999 none was adjourned at the request of the applicant. During the proceedings the court appointed a medical expert. At the last hearing the court decided to deliver a written judgment. The judgment, upholding the applicant’s claim in part, was served on the applicant on 1 March 1999. 8. On 16 March 1999 ZT appealed to the Celje Higher Court contesting the part of the judgment referring to costs and expenses of the proceedings. On 16 February 2000 the court allowed the appeal in part and remanded the case back to the first-instance court for re-examination. The decision was served on the applicant on 21 March 2000. 9. Between 6 July 2000 and 13 March 2001 the applicant lodged four rush notices with the first-instance court. On 6 April 2001 the first-instance court issued a new decision on costs and expenses. The decision was served on the applicant on 11 April 2001. 10. On 11 May 2001 ZT appealed to the Celje Higher Court. On 18 July 2002 the court rejected the appeal.

108,108,"The applicant, born in 1955, is a Turkish citizen who is resident in İzmir. He is a driver. The facts of the present case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. In early 1991 the applicant filed a petition with the İzmir Governor’s office for leave to participate in a public auction for 150 commercial taxi licence plates, which was to take place on 6 June 1991. On 24 May 1991 the İzmir Security Directorate’s Traffic Commission rejected the applicant’s request on the ground that he did not meet the eligibility requirements for the auction. On 13 June 1991 the Traffic Commission sent a letter to the applicant explaining that his request was rejected because he was earning his living not only as a driver but also as a cloth-seller, as indicated in the information in the registry of the Basmane Tax Office in İzmir. The Commission further explained that, under decree no. 86/10553, only those earning their living as drivers were eligible to take part in the auction. On 14 June 1991 the applicant brought an action before the İzmir Administrative Court. He alleged that he was eligible for the auction because he worked as a driver and was a member of the İzmir Drivers’ and Automobilists’ Association. He also stated that he had stopped working as a cloth-seller long before the auction. He asked the court to set aside the Traffic Commission’s decision of 24 May 1991 and to order a stay of execution of the decisions taken at the auction. On 20 January 1994 the İzmir Administrative Court set aside the Traffic Commission’s decision of 24 May 1991. It held that the applicant would be eligible for similar auctions in the future. The court rejected the applicant’s request for an order to stay the execution of the auction decisions. On 10 March 1995 the applicant brought an action before the İzmir Administrative Court against the İzmir Governor’s office. He alleged that he had suffered a loss of three billion Turkish liras because he could not work as a taxicab driver as he was not admitted to the auction and could not buy a taxicab licence plate. On 9 November 1995 the İzmir Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s action. The court stated that even if the applicant had been admitted to the auction, he would not necessarily have succeeded in buying a taxicab licence plate. The court further considered that the applicant’s claim was based on assumption and that he had not suffered damage. It held that the applicant would be eligible for future auctions according to the Administrative Court’s decision of 20 January 1994. On 17 January 1996 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Supreme Administrative Court (Conseil d’Etat) against the judgment of 9 November 1995. On 3 March 1997 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal.",0,475
110,110,"The applicant, Mr Juraj Horňák, is a Slovak national who was born in 1959 and lives in Bratislava. He was represented before the Court by Ms E. Kliniecová, a lawyer practising in Bratislava. The Slovak Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs M. Pirošíková. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 12 April 2000 the applicant challenged several decisions taken by the general meeting of a limited liability company on 23 March 2000. The members of the chamber of the Žilina Regional Court to whom the case fell to be examined requested to be excluded. They explained that they had a negative opinion of the applicant in view of his inappropriate behaviour in other sets of proceedings. On 27 June 2000 the Supreme Court refused to exclude those judges. On 27 October 2000 the Regional Court discontinued the proceedings as the applicant had not paid court fees within the time-limit set. On 8 December 2000 it quashed that decision as the applicant had subsequently paid the fees. On 5 February 2001 the Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s action. On 9 April 2002 the Supreme Court quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case to the Regional Court. In the later period the file was transferred to the Supreme Court several times in order to decide on (i) the applicant’s requests to exclude the judges from dealing with the case and to transfer the case to another court, and (ii) the judges’ requests to be excluded from the examination of the case, inter alia on the ground that they and the applicant were involved in litigation. On 9 September 2004 the Regional Court found in the applicant’s favour. The judgment was served on him on 11 February 2005. On 15 March 2005 the defendant appealed. On 13 April 2005 the Constitutional Court found that the Regional Court had not violated the applicant’s right to a hearing within a reasonable time. The case was not complex, but the applicant by his conduct had significantly contributed to the length of the proceedings in that (i) he had not paid the court fees on time, (ii) he had repeatedly challenged judges and had requested that the case be transferred to a different court and (iii) he had not appeared before the Regional Court on 5 February 2001. As to the conduct of the Regional Court, there was a single delay between 18 December 2002 and 23 May 2003. Otherwise the Regional Court had proceeded with the case in an appropriate manner. The file was transferred to the Supreme Court on 27 April 2005. On 27 July 2006 the Supreme Court found against the applicant. The judgment became final on 20 September 2006. On 29 December 2000 the applicant filed an action with the Žilina Regional Court. He challenged the validity of decisions which the general meeting of a limited liability company had taken on 8 December 2000. On 4 January 2001 the President of the Regional Court asked the Supreme Court to exclude three Regional Court judges from examination of the case. She argued that the judges were biased because the applicant, who had been a party to numerous sets of proceedings before the same Regional Court (for example the proceedings mentioned under the point A above), had behaved in an arrogant manner towards the judges in those proceedings. She also stated that the applicant had lodged an action for protection of his integrity against those judges. On 4 February 2002 the Supreme Court exempted the judges from examination of the case. Subsequently the newly appointed judges also requested, on three occasions, to be excluded from examination of the case. The Supreme Court examined the requests for the total period of approximately two months and did not exempt the judges from dealing with the case. On 19 May 2003 the Regional Court asked the applicant to pay the court fees within ten days. As he had failed to do so, the proceedings were discontinued on 26 January 2004. After the decision to discontinue the proceedings had been served on the applicant, he paid the fees. On 18 August 2004 the Constitutional Court found that the Regional Court had not violated the applicant’s right to a hearing within a reasonable time. The Constitutional Court noted that the applicant had been obliged to pay the fees at the time of filing his action. He had done so after the Regional Court had decided to discontinue the proceedings. It concluded that the applicant was not genuinely interested in having the point in issue determined in the proceedings complained of and that his complaint about delays in those proceedings was therefore devoid of substance. On 29 October 2004 the Regional Court quashed its decision of 26 January 2004 noting that the applicant had paid the court fees. The Regional Court found against the applicant on 20 April 2006. In the absence of an appeal, the judgment became final on 3 January 2007.",0,835
111,111,"The applicant is a Turkish national, born in Yeşilhisar and living in Kayseri, Turkey. A. Circumstances of the case The applicant was formerly a public prosecutor. In 1993 he wrote a letter to the Minister of Interior criticising him as well as a political party forming part of the coalition government for, inter alia, the continuation of the terrorist campaign. He stated that the party in question had been elected on the backs of the terrorists. Furthermore he criticised a number of new amendments made to the law on criminal procedure which were intended to increase the rights of the accused. The applicant repeated the same views and opinions in a book which he published. On 9 June 1994 the Supreme Board of Judges and Public Prosecutors (Hakimler ve Savcılar Yüksek Kurulu : “the Supreme Board”) held that his statements were highly political and incompatible with the objectivity required by his functions. The Supreme Board transferred him to a lesser jurisdiction for disciplinary reasons. The applicant requested the Supreme Board to rectify (“yeniden inceleme”) its decision. On 15 February 1994 his request was rejected. The applicant then raised an objection (“itiraz”) to the decision before the Objections Examination Board (İtirazları İnceleme Kurulu: “the Objections Board”). On 16 March 1995 the Objections Board upheld the Supreme Board’s decision. On several occasions in 1994 the applicant made oral comments to his colleagues or published poems expressing his disapproval of the activities of the above-mentioned political party. He gave a television interview in which he criticised the Supreme Board’s decision to transfer him as well as the Board’s structure. On 9 March 1995 the Supreme Board again ruled that the applicant’s statements and conduct were highly political and incompatible with the objectivity requirements of his office. The Supreme Board found, inter alia, that the applicant had been behaving “like a professional politician”. The Supreme Board also found that the applicant had spent his sick leave in a distant locality without prior permission. On the basis of these two grounds the Supreme Board again transferred the applicant to a lesser jurisdiction for disciplinary reasons. The applicant requested the Supreme Board to rectify this decision. On 20 April 1995 his request was rejected. The applicant then raised an objection to the initial decision with the Objections Board. On 25 September 1995 the Objections Board upheld the decision. Subsequently the Supreme Board noted that the applicant had been given two disciplinary punishments. It held on 29 February 1996 that, in accordance with section 69 § 2 of Law no. 2802, the applicant should be removed from office. The applicant requested the Supreme Board to rectify this decision. In the meantime, on 3 April 1996, the applicant resigned from his functions. On 23 September 1996 the Supreme Board re-examined the applicant’s disciplinary file and upheld the decision of 29 February 1996. The applicant raised objection to the decision of the Supreme Board. In his petition of 5 May 1997 to the Objections Board the applicant wrote inter alia that he had voluntarily (“kendi isteğimle”) resigned and requested that the administrative punishment (removal from office) be, at least, converted to a lighter form of punishment. The applicant was heard in person by the Objections Board on 5 May 1997. On the same day the Objections Board ruled that the Supreme Board’s decision of 29 February 1996 was taken in accordance with the law. B. Relevant domestic law According to Article 68(b) of the Code on Judges and Public Prosecutors, conduct of a judge or public prosecutor which is considered incompatible with the impartiality requirements of his functions renders him liable to be transferred to a lesser jurisdiction. According to Article 69 of the Code, any judge or public prosecutor who has been sanctioned for disciplinary reasons on two occasions by being transferred to a lesser jurisdiction shall be liable to be removed form office.",0,646

Prior to that he was detained at HMP Magilligan, County Derry, Northern Ireland, on temporary transfer from a Scottish prison while serving a seven year sentence for a drug offence. 7. On 1 July 1996 a sealed letter sent by him to the Scottish Minister of State was returned to him by the prison authorities. Following the Court’s admissibility decision, the Government informed the Court that the Prison Service was unable to explain why the letter had not been sent, since there was nothing untoward in its content. 8. The relevant domestic legislation is the Prison and Young Offenders Centre Rules (Northern Ireland) 1995 (“the Rules”), which came into effect on 1 March 1995. 9. Rule 67(1) allows the Secretary of State to impose restrictions on communications between a prisoner and others, either generally or in a particular case, with a view to securing discipline and good order or the prevention of crime or in the interests of any persons. Under Rule 67(4), except as provided by the Rules, every letter or communication to or from a prisoner may be read or examined by the Governor who may, at his discretion, stop any such letter on the grounds that it is not permitted under paragraph (1) or that it may undermine the prison’s security.",1,229
120,120,"1. The applicant, Mr Christian Obrist, is an Austrian national, who was born in 1954 and lives in Zell am See. 2. The Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ambassador H. Tichy, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of European and International Affairs. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. On 3 March 2003 the applicant, a practising lawyer, was served with a decision dated 25 February 2003 by the Zell am See Tax Authority (Finanzamt Zell am See als Finanzstrafbehörde I. Instanz) informing him that proceedings had been initiated against him on suspicion of evasion of both income and turnover tax, through his submission of incorrect declarations of earnings in both the years 1999 and 2001. 5. The panel at the Salzburg Stadt Tax Authority (Spruchsenat beim Finanzamt Salzburg-Stadt) held five hearings, namely on 20 April 2004 and 9 February, 6 April, 14 September and 18 October 2005, of which only the first two were attended by the applicant. The applicant was aware that his former employee, witness X, would be required to testify in the proceedings; however three hearings were postponed when witness X failed to appear. When X finally appeared at the hearing of 18 October 2005 it transpired that the applicant had relied on X’s duty of confidentiality on account of his previous employment contract with the applicant, and X could not then testify. 6. The applicant did not receive a transcript of the hearing. The applicant had not lodged a request to receive the transcript until the hearing was under way. 7. On 18 October 2005 the Tax Authority panel found the applicant guilty of having evaded tax in the amount of almost 51,000 euros (EUR) and ordered him to pay a fine of EUR 20,000, which would be replaced, in the event of default, by a prison term of four weeks. The applicant was, however, acquitted of having evaded turnover tax in 1999. In fixing the amount of the fine, the panel considered the following to be mitigating factors: the applicant’s lack of any prior convictions, his partial payment of the money owed, his confession in respect of part of the charges and the long period of time that had elapsed since the offences had been committed. It did not find any aggravating factors. The written decision of 18 October 2005 was served on the applicant on 18 May 2006. 8. On 19 June 2006 the applicant appealed to the Independent Finance Panel (Unabhängiger Finanzsenat), which delivered its decision orally after a hearing on 6 December 2007. The Independent Finance Panel reduced the amount of the fine to EUR 12,500, with sixteen days’ imprisonment in the event of default. Among the reasons given by the Independent Finance Panel for the reduction of the fine was the applicant’s low income, and it cited the long duration of the proceedings as a further mitigating factor in addition to those already put forward by the Tax Authority panel. On the other hand, it considered that the fact that the applicant was a practising lawyer constituted an aggravating factor. The written decision was served on the applicant on 14 August 2008. 9. The applicant lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof) on 25 September 2008 against the decision of the Independent Finance Panel. In a decision dated 8 October 2008 the Constitutional Court declined to consider the case for its lack of prospects of success and sent it to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof). The decision of the Constitutional Court was served on the applicant on 14 October 2008. 10. The applicant filed additional observations in support of his complaint to the Administrative Court as requested. On 8 July 2009 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint as ill-founded. It held that the Independent Finance Panel had acted appropriately in taking the unreasonably lengthy duration of the proceedings and the applicant’s poor financial situation into consideration and had set the fine accordingly and in line with the domestic courts’ jurisprudence. It also held that the applicant should have applied to receive a transcript of the hearing by the time it had started, as was provided for by law. 11. The decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on 27 August 2009. 12. The jurisdiction of the tax authorities as regards proceedings relating to tax offences and the conduct of such proceedings are regulated in the Tax Offences Act (Finanzstrafgesetz). 13. In accordance with section 135 of the above-mentioned Act, in force at the relevant time, oral hearings are to be recorded by the court reporter. Its subsection 3 provides that the transcript of the hearing is to be signed by the presiding member of the panel and the court reporter and then handed over to the defendant if he or she has lodged a prior request for it which has to be submitted, at the latest, just after the opening of the oral hearing. 14. Section 33 § 5 of the Tax Offences Act provides, as a maximum penalty for the offence of tax evasion, for the imposition of a monetary fine of double the amount of tax evaded. It also provides for the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for up to two years.",0,884
128,128,"The applicant, Mr Robin Wood, is a British national who was born in 1948 and lives in Cheshire. He was represented before the Court by Pierce Glynn, solicitors in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant’s wife died on 19 August 1999, leaving one child born in 1970. In April or May 2000 the applicant applied for widows’ benefits. On 4 May 2000 the applicant was informed that his claim had been disallowed as he was not a woman. By a letter of 12 June 2000 the benefits’ agency confirmed their decision and the lack of his right to an appeal. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefit was payable to widowers under United Kingdom law. The applicant was not in receipt of child benefit at the time of his claim. The domestic law relevant to this application is set out in Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, §§ 1426, ECHR 2002-IV and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, §§ 40-41, 25 July 2007.",0,219
130,130,"5. The applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Simferopol. 6. The applicant was born with congenital facial injury and was diagnosed with a “midline cranial cleft”. Between 1990 and 1997 she repeatedly underwent surgery in a clinic in the United States of America, following which her cranial disorders were mostly cured. However, owing to the extensive surgery, the applicant developed a mental illness. Since then she has needed regular supervision in the United States clinic. 7. In 2007 the applicant’s father applied to the Simferopol District Court of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea (“the District Court”), seeking to have her deprived of legal capacity on the ground that she suffered from serious mental illness. 8. Following a request by the District Court, on 5 June 2007 a forensic psychiatric expert issued an opinion stating that the applicant suffered from a chronic mental illness, namely paranoid schizophrenia, which prevented her from comprehending and controlling her actions. 9. On 10 July 2007 the District Court deprived the applicant of her legal capacity. The decision was not appealed against and became final. 10. On 21 November 2007 the applicant’s sister was assigned as the applicant’s guardian (опікун). 11. Gradually, the applicant’s mental health improved, so that on 3 April 2008 she took up a position at a local factory. 12. In 2009 the applicant’s guardian applied to the District Court for restoration of the applicant’s legal capacity. However, on 30 October 2009 the application was dismissed without being considered on the merits owing to the guardian’s repeated failure to appear in court. 13. On 1 November 2010 the applicant applied on her own to the District Court, seeking restoration of her legal capacity. She specified that Article 241 § 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which did not provide for the right for an incapacitated person to submit such an application, was not compatible with international legal standards and was discriminatory. 14. On 4 November 2010 the District Court returned the application to the applicant without considering it on the merits, noting that, by virtue of Article 121 § 3 and Article 241 § 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the applicant was not entitled to submit such an application. 15. On 12 January 2011 the court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 4 November 2010 noting that Article 241 § 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure did not provide the applicant with the right to lodge an application for restoration of her legal capacity. The District Court had therefore lawfully returned the application without considering it on the merits, as required by Article 121 § 3 of that Code. On 12 March 2011 the court of cassation dismissed as unfounded the applicant’s appeal on points of law. 16. Article 67 of the Code provides that a guardian is obliged to take measures for the protection of the civil rights and interests of the person who is under his or her guardianship. 17. Article 121 § 3 of the Code provides that a court cannot accept a claim for consideration on the merits if it has been submitted by a person deprived of legal capacity. 18. Article 241 § 4 of the Code provides that a court decision declaring a physical person entirely incapable may be quashed and the legal capacity of that person may be restored by another court decision provided that the person has been cured or his or her mental state has significantly improved. Such a decision is to be taken upon an application submitted by the guardian or the guardianship authority (орган опіки та піклування) and must be supported by relevant conclusions by a forensic psychiatric expert. 19. This Order requires the guardianship authorities, among other things, to supervise the activities of guardians and to take measures for the protection of the rights of persons who have been placed under guardianship.",1,651
131,131,"1. The applicant, Mr Vitaliy Sergeyevich Petrov, is a Russian national who was born in 1948 and lives in Orsk. He is represented before the Court by Mr S. Kiryukhin, a lawyer practising in Orsk, Orenburg region. 2. The Russian Government (“the Government”) are represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. On 19 August 2008 the Orenburg Region Department of the Interior opened a criminal investigation of the activities of Volna LLC. Yu., the director of the said company, testified that S. Kiryukhin was de facto in charge of the company’s activities. 5. The investigator established that Mr Kiryukhin had visited a certain law office on several occasions, and asked the court to authorise a search of its premises in order to seize the company’s financial documents and stamps. 6. On 27 August 2004 the Orsk Leninskiy District Court granted the investigator’s request. The court order referred to a search of a law office located in a block of flats. Neither the applicant’s name nor specific flats owned by him were indicated. The applicant’s flats were searched the same day on the basis of the court order. 7. On 7 September 2004 the applicant complained to the court. He sought to have the search declared unlawful. 8. On 4 November 2004 the District Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. The court found that the search had been carried out in accordance with the applicable provisions of the rules of criminal procedure. The applicant appealed, alleging that the court had erred in matters of law. 9. On 14 December 2004 the Orenburg Regional Court upheld the decision of 4 November 2004 on appeal. The court dismissed the applicant’s allegations as unsubstantiated and found no violation of any applicable law. The court noted that the search had been subject to prior judicial approval and had been conducted by authorised persons. 10. On 27 April 2009 the Presidium of the Orenburg Regional Court quashed, by way of supervisory review, the decisions of 4 November and 14 December 2004 and remitted the matter for fresh consideration. 11. On 14 May 2009 the District Court allowed the applicant’s claim and found the search of the applicant’s flats to be in contravention of Article 25 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation. The court established that the order of 27 August 2004 had not authorised a search of the applicant’s flats. It also accepted the applicant’s argument that police officer A., who had conducted the search of the flats, had not been authorised to do so. 12. On 23 June 2009 the Regional Court upheld the decision of 14 May 2009 on appeal. 13. The Constitution of the Russian Federation establishes that the home is inviolable. No one shall enter a dwelling against the will of those living there, unless otherwise established by a federal law or in accordance with a court order (Article 25).",0,505
135,135,"The applicant is a Greek citizen born in 1921. He is an honorary vice-president of the State Audit Council (Ελεγκτικό Συνέδριο) and resides in Athens. The facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows. On 1 July 1984 the post of vice-president of the State Audit Court was declared vacant. At that time the applicant was the senior judge. The post remained vacant for three years and was filled by the applicant on 30 July 1987. On 28 November 1988 the applicant brought an action for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages against the State before the First Instance Administrative Court of Athens. In particular, the applicant claimed that he should have been promoted soon after the post was declared vacant and that the delay of the Administration to promote him to the post of vice-president of the State Audit Court caused him pecuniary damage and raised suspicions as to his abilities. On 6 October 1989 the Court granted the applicant’s claim insofar as it concerned non-pecuniary damage. The Court dismissed the remainder of the applicant’s action on the ground that he had no enforceable claim to the vacant post. On 24 November and 29 December 1989 respectively the applicant and the State appealed against this decision. On 17 May 1990 the Athens Administrative Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal and annulled the decision of the First Instance Administrative Court. The Court of Appeal referred in particular to the discretionary powers by which the competent administrative authorities organised their activity. On 15 July 1990 the applicant appealed to the Council of State. On 23 January 1995 the First Chamber of the Council of State composed of five judges decided to refer the case to a Chamber composed of seven judges. On 27 November 1995 the First Chamber of the Council of State composed of seven judges decided to refer the case to the Plenary because of the important issues it raised. On 17 October 1997 the Council of State sitting in Plenary rejected the applicant’s appeal. In particular the Council of State held that it was beyond the competence of the Court of Appeal to decide whether the decision to promote the applicant should be backdated. Therefore the Court of Appeal was right in rejecting the applicant’s appeal. The applicant obtained a copy of that decision in January 1998.",0,394
136,136,"The applicant, Mr Giuliano Sinkovič, is a Slovenian national who was born in 1949 and lives in Piran. He was represented before the Court by Mr E. Dokič, a lawyer practising in Piran. In 1992 a company, HIT, published in a local newspaper an invitation to submit proposals for the name of a new casino. A reward of 100,000 Slovenian tolars (approximately 415 euros) was promised to the person whose proposal was chosen. The applicant sent a list of 107 proposals in the prescribed period. On 21 August 1992 HIT informed the applicant about the two chosen proposals, neither of which had been picked out of the applicant’s list. It appears that the name that the new casino was finally given was not one of the chosen ones, but one from the applicant’s list. Therefore, in 1994 the applicant, relying on the provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act (Zakon o avtorski in sorodnih pravicah), requested the Ljubljana District Court to disallow further use of the casino’s name and to order HIT to remove all visible signs containing it. The company would have been exempted from this obligation if it had paid the applicant the amount of 20,000,000 Slovenian tolars (approximately 83,330 euros). On 25 September 2000 the court rejected the applicant’s claim. It held that the term from the applicant’s list, finally used to name the casino, did not constitute the work of an author and was therefore not protected by copyright. It concluded that the applicant could have claimed the promised reward (see above), but had failed to do so. On an unspecified date the applicant appealed to the Ljubljana Higher Court (Višje sodišče v Ljubljani). On 20 December 2000 the court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. On 22 March 2001 the applicant, not represented by a lawyer, lodged a constitutional appeal. On 18 December 2002 the Constitutional Court (Ustavno sodišče) dismissed the applicant’s appeal. The applicant did not indicate the date on which this decision was served on him. The applicant dated his first letter to the Court 23 June 2003. The applicant posted it, as a registered letter, at 7.05 p.m. on 24 June 2003 at the post office in Piran. On 27 July 2004 the applicant lodged a duly completed application form, nearly a year after receiving the Court’s letter advising him to do so.

137,137,"The applicant is a Turkish national, born in 1958, and living in Natters. He is represented before the Court by Mr. Horst Lumper, a lawyer practising in Bregenz. The applicant came to Austria in November 1989 without having a valid visa. In 1990 the Innsbruck District Administrative Authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft) found him guilty of illegal entry and imposed a fine of 2,200 Austrian Schillings (ATS) on him. Subsequently, the applicant obtained a residence permit which was periodically renewed. In August 1991 his wife, who is also a Turkish national, as well as their son, born in 1975, and their daughter, born in 1985, were allowed to join him under a family reunion scheme. The applicant found employment as a worker. In 1993 the Innsbruck District Administrative Authority found him guilty of drunken driving and imposed a fine of ATS 12,100 on him. In 1994 the same authority found him guilty of refusing to undergo a breathalyser test when being reasonably suspected of drunken driving and imposed a fine of ATS 15, 400 on him. On 9 February 1995 the Innsbruck District Administrative Authority issued a residence ban valid for five years against the applicant. Referring to S. 18 § 1 and § 2 (2) of the 1992 Aliens Act (Fremdengesetz), according to which a residence ban has to be issued against an alien, inter alia, if he has been convicted more than once of a serious administrative offence, it found that the applicant’s convictions for drunken driving in 1993 and refusing to undergo a breathalyser test in 1994 constituted such serious offences. Although the residence ban constituted an interference with the applicant’s private and family life, this measure was necessary, as there were specific reasons to fear that his further stay would be a danger for public security. On 22 February 1995 the applicant, represented by counsel, filed an appeal. He argued that the residence ban against him was disproportionate, as the offences committed by him were not of a serious nature. Moreover, it forced him to separate from his family who were dependent on his income. Further, the applicant argued that Austria had become a member of the European Union on 1 January 1995 and was therefore bound by the Association Agreement between the European Union and Turkey. According to this Agreement and the decisions on its implementation, Turkish workers who had been legally employed in a member State for four years had a right of free access to the employment market and also to a residence permit. Moreover, measures of public security against such workers could not be based solely on criminal convictions but had to be justified by the specific conduct of the person concerned. On 3 October 1995 the Tyrol Public Security Authority (Sicherheitsdirektion) dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It confirmed that the applicant’s convictions in 1993 and 1994, relating to drunken driving and refusing a breathalyser test, constituted serious administrative offences within the meaning of S. 18 § 2 (2) of the Aliens Act. Referring to S. 20 of the said Act which requires the authority to weigh the negative consequences the residence ban would have for the alien and his family against the public interest in issuing a residence ban, it found in particular that the applicant had only lived in Austria since 1989 and his family since 1991. Moreover, his family could leave Austria with him. Having regard to the conduct of the applicant and the particular risks it entailed for life and limb as well as the property of others, he had to be considered as a danger for public safety. In sum, the interest in issuing the residence ban outweighed the interests of the applicant and his family in staying in Austria. Finally, the Association Agreement between the European Union and Turkey, relied on by the applicant, did not prohibit the issuing of a residence ban. On 25 October 1995 the applicant filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof). He repeated the arguments he had already forwarded in his appeal to the Public Security Authority. On 27 November 1995 the Constitutional Court refused to entertain the applicant’s complaint and referred the case to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof). On 20 March 1996 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. It found that the contested residence ban was necessary within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights in the interests of public safety and the prevention of crime. Referring on the one hand to the gravity of the offences committed by the applicant and on the other hand to his short stay in Austria, the Court confirmed that the Public Security Authority had duly weighed the interests involved.",0,781
144,144,"7. The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in Birmingham. 8. The applicant, aged sixty three, would not become eligible for a State pension until he was sixty five, whereas a woman could claim a State pension from age sixty. He was currently unemployed but if he returned to work he and any potential employer would be liable to make national insurance contributions. 9. On 4 February 2002, the applicant issued proceedings for damages in the High Court against the Benefits Agency, alleging inter alia that the refusal to pay him a pension from the age of sixty was discriminatory. On 2 October 2002, the applicant’s claim was struck out on the basis that the particulars of claim disclosed no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim (Civil Procedure Rule 3.4.2.). On 27 February 2003, permission to appeal was refused. 10. Section 122 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 defines “pensionable age” as: “(a) the age of 65, in the case of a man; and (b) the age of 60, in the case of a woman”. 11. Section 126 of the Pensions Act 1995 provides for the equalisation of State pension ages for men and women to the age of 65. The State pension age for women will increase gradually from 2010 and the equalisation will be complete in 2020. At the same time, the age until which women are liable to pay national insurance contributions will gradually increase in line with the increase in the State pension age. 12. Council Directive 79/7/EEC of 19 December 1978 provides for the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security. However, in Article 7(1)(a) the Directive provides for derogation in the matter of “the determination of pensionable age for the purposes of granting old-age and retirement pensions and the possible consequences therefore for other benefits”. 13. In Case C-9/91 The Queen v. Secretary of State for Social Security, ex parte Equal Opportunities Commission [1992] ECR 1-4297 (“the EOC case” concerning a reference for a preliminary ruling from the High Court), the European Court of Justice found that: Article 7(1)a had to be interpreted as authorising the determination of a statutory pensionable age which differs according to sex for the purposes of granting old-age and retirement pensions and also forms of discrimination which are necessarily linked to that difference; Inequality between men and women with respect to the length of contribution periods required to obtain a pension constitutes such discrimination where, having regard to the financial equilibrium of the national pension system in the context in which it appears, it cannot be dissociated from a difference in pensionable age; In view of the advantages allowed to women by national pension systems, in particular as regards statutory pensionable age and length of contribution periods, and the disruption that would necessarily be caused to the equilibrium of those systems if the principle of equality between the sexes were to be applied from one day to the next in respect of those periods, the Community legislature intended to authorise the progressive implementation of that principle by the member States and that progressive nature could not be ensured if the scope of the derogation authorised by Article 7(1)a were to be interpreted restrictively.",0,548
145,145,"The applicant, Mr Clarence Hornby, is a British national who was born in 1945 and lives in Wigan. He was unrepresented before the Court. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant’s wife died on 8 March 2001, leaving no dependent children. His claim for widows’ benefits was made on 17 June 2001 and was rejected on 31 June 2001 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows’ benefits because he was not a woman. This decision was confirmed by an appeal tribunal on 8 October 2001. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law. The domestic law relevant to this application is set out in Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, §§ 1426, ECHR 2002-IV and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, §§ 40-41, 25 July 2007.",0,190
147,147,"4. The applicant, Mr Anatoliy Pavlovych Voytenko, is a Ukrainian national who was born in 1961 and resides in the village of Nova Vodolaga, in the Kharkiv Region, Ukraine. 5. In September 1999, the applicant retired from the army. Upon retirement, the applicant was entitled to compensation for his uniform and to reimbursement of his travel expenses. As this compensation remained unpaid for three months, the applicant instituted proceedings in the Donetsk Garrison Military Court against the Donetsk Regional Military Registration Department (Донецкий Областной Военный Комиссариат), seeking recovery of the debt. 6. On 12 January 2000, the court found for the applicant (Решение Военного суда Донецкого гарнизона) and awarded him UAH 2,576.72 for the uniform and UAH 128.77 for travel expenses. The court decision was not appealed and therefore came into force on 22 January 2000. The execution writs were sent to the Voroshylovsky District Bailiffs’ Service of Donetsk (Отдел Государственной исполнительной службы Ворошиловского районного управления юстиции Донецкой области) and the enforcement proceedings started on 16 March 2000. 7. The debtor was given time to execute the judgment voluntarily, until 23 March 2000. After the debtor had failed to execute the judgment, the Bailiffs’ Service sent the execution writs and payment orders to the Donetsk Regional Treasury Department to withdraw the amount of the award from the debtor’s account, which revealed a lack of funds for such payments. 8. On 10 April 2000, the payment order and execution writ were returned to the Bailiffs’ Service without execution due to the debtor’s lack of funds. 9. On 17 May 2000, the enforcement proceedings in the applicant’s favour were joined to other enforcement proceedings against the debtor. 10. On 24 October 2000, the debtor transferred to the Bailiffs’ Service the amount of UAH 128.77 (the reimbursement of the travel expenses) to be paid to the applicant. However, this sum was only transferred to the applicant on 20 July 2001 (4 October 2001 according to the applicant). The delay, according to the Government, was caused by a lack of information about the applicant’s banking details. 11. On 7 November 2000 and 20 July 2001, the execution writ and the payment order for the remaining amount (the compensation for the uniform) were twice re-sent to the Treasury Department. They were returned without enforcement on the same grounds as before – a lack of funds on the designated account. 12. On 9 September 2001 the Bailiffs’ Service checked and attached the debtor’s accounts. The Bailiffs also checked and found that the debtor had no vehicles or real estate in its possession. 13. On 22 February and 6 August 2002 the execution writ for the remaining amount and the payment order were twice re-sent to the Treasury Department. They were returned without enforcement on the same grounds. The Treasury Department also noted that the payment order had expired on 6 September 2002. 14. In response to the applicant’s inquiry, he was informed by the Bailiffs’ Service in August 2002 that the debtor’s accounts had been frozen and that the execution of his judgment would take place as soon as State budgetary money could be transferred to it. 15. On 25 November 2002, joint enforcement proceedings against the debtor, including the applicant’s judgment, were initiated by the Bailiffs’ Service for a total amount of UAH 32,680.80. 16. On 16 December 2002, the Bailiffs’ Service attached the debtor’s account in the “Aval” Bank. 17. On 5 May 2003, the Bailiffs’ Service also ordered an attachment of the debtor’s funds which had accumulated in 26 accounts. 18. On 10 January 2004, the judgment given in the applicant’s favour was enforced in full. 19. On 12 January 2004, the amount awarded was transferred to the applicant’s bank account. 20. Article 124 of the Constitution provided as follows: “... Judicial decisions are adopted by the courts in the name of Ukraine and are mandatory for execution throughout the entire territory of Ukraine.” 21. Under Article 2 of the Law, the enforcement of judgments is entrusted to the State Bailiffs’ Service. Under Article 85 of the Law, the creditor may file a complaint against actions or omissions of the State Bailiffs’ Service with the head of the competent department for that Service or with a local court. Article 86 of the Law entitles the creditor to institute court proceedings against a legal person, entrusted with the enforcement of a judgment, for inadequate enforcement or non-enforcement of a judgement, and to receive compensation. 22. Article 11 of the Law provides for the liability of bailiffs for any inadequate performance of their duties, as well as compensation for damage caused by a bailiff when enforcing a judgment. Under Article 13 of the Law, acts and omissions of the bailiff can be challenged before a superior official or the courts. 23. According to Article 5 of the Law, accounts other than the one designated for a particular payment, as well as the property of the Armed Forces, cannot be used to enforce a court decision. 24. Under clause 3.6 of the regulations, the forced recovery of funds must be executed from the same account as that of ordinary payments. 25. The law suspended certain provisions of the Law of Ukraine “on the social welfare and legal protection of military personnel and their families”, in particular with regard to compensation for clothing and travel expenses.",1,889
148,148,"The applicant, Robert Doubtfire, is a United Kingdom national, who was born in 1961. He was represented before the Court by Ms Cunneen, a solicitor of Liberty, an organisation based in London. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 6 May 1993 the applicant was arrested in a depot after he had unloaded a tanker lorry in which ecstasy tablets and amphetamine sulphate had been imported into the United Kingdom. In January 1994 the applicant appeared before the Maidstone Crown Court to be tried on charges of being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the prohibition on the importation of drugs. The applicant accepted that he had unloaded the lorry. However, it was the applicant’s case that he had no knowledge of the nature of the consignment and that he had been set up by someone called “W.S.” as a “cut-out”, i.e. a person put in place by someone in charge of an illegal operation to insulate himself from detection and arrest. As it transpired from the record of all the calls made from the applicant’s mobile telephone, the applicant, while unloading the lorry and at other critical times, had repeatedly called W.S.’s telephone number. During the trial the prosecution made an ex parte application to the trial judge to withhold evidence. The judge looked at the material and endorsed the prosecution’s view that the material was covered by public interest immunity. The defence were not told the category of the material which was the subject of the application and did not have the opportunity of making representations to the judge. On 2 February 1994, the applicant’s counsel made ex parte submissions to the judge concerning the relevance of material relating to W.S. to the defence’s case. However, the judge did not accede to the defence’s request for the disclosure of the material which had been withheld, nor to the disclosure of the category of the material, and further declined to make a ruling in open court as to why the applicant was not entitled to material relating to W.S. All the judge could tell the defence was that in cross-examination he would not allow them to ask questions relating to investigations concerning W.S. On 16 February 1994 the applicant was found guilty and given two sentences of 25 and 12 years’ imprisonment to run concurrently. The applicant appealed relying, inter alia, on the non-disclosure of material concerning W.S. The applicant also submitted that the prosecution might have also withheld evidence concerning another witness, “H”. A single judge gave the applicant leave to appeal against sentence and referred to the Court of Appeal his application for leave to appeal against conviction. Two days before examining the applicant’s appeal, the Court of Appeal examined ex parte all the material that was before the trial judge. It decided not to order any further disclosure. The Court of Appeal’s first judgment was delivered on 30 November 1995. It found that the applicant had been able to run his defence as he wished and had, in particular, been able to put before the jury the fact that W.S. had a criminal record and that the prosecution had suspicions about him. This, together with the applicant’s own testimony, had enabled the jury to assess the extent, if any, of W.S.’s involvement in the case. For these reasons, the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s ground of appeal concerning disclosure. The court did not find any merit in the applicant’s other grounds of appeal and upheld his conviction. However, it reduced the first concurrent sentence from 25 to 20 years’ imprisonment. On 6 July 2000 the Criminal Cases Review Commission (“CCRC”) referred the applicant’s case back to the Court of Appeal on the ground that: “As a result of the [CCRC’s] enquires, the CCRC has concluded that there was a failure by the prosecution in respect of its disclosure obligations in the context of submissions made by the [prosecution] to the trial judge in the context of submissions made by the [prosecution] to the trial judge in the course of ex parte hearings. The [CCRC] considers that this failure was material to [the applicant’s] defence and to his mitigation. ...” The precise nature of the failure of disclosure was expanded upon in a confidential annex to the CCRC’s report. On 19 December 2000 the Court of Appeal quashed the applicant’s conviction on both counts and quashed the order for prosecution costs. The court examined the confidential annex to the CCRC’s report in private. It held that: “... the [applicant’s] trial was materially unfair in the way the [CCRC] describes. That is sufficient for our conclusion that this appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed.” The Court of Appeal continued: “We have considered whether it is right that the Court should elaborate on that conclusion by giving detailed reasons, by reference to the confidential material which has been put before the Court, to explain why we have reached that conclusion. We are persuaded that the balance of competing public interest in this case falls on the side of not making the material public, and not making public the detailed reason’s for the [CCRC’s] conclusion. We have found that particular point a difficult one, and we have sought ... whether there is a halfway house in this case. We have, with some regret, reached the conclusion that there is not, and in reaching that conclusion we are acutely aware of the clear fact that justice is required to be conducted openly and in public, and that exceptions to this should only occur in cases in which there is indeed an overriding public interest which so requires it.” As a result of the Court of Appeal’s judgment, the applicant may now apply for compensation for his conviction and imprisonment under section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988.",0,980
153,153,"4. The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in Moscow. 5. On 1 February 2001 the applicant brought proceedings against a private company for breach of his patent rights. 6. By a judgment of 10 November 2002 the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow (“the District Court”) dismissed his claim. 7. On 28 November 2003 the Moscow City Court (“the appeal court”) upheld the above judgment on appeal. 8. On 4 November 2000 the applicant instituted another set of proceedings against two private companies for breach of his patent rights. 9. The first hearing was scheduled by the District Court for 4 April 2001. However, the first hearing and the next four hearings did not take place because the judge was involved in different proceedings or was on vacation, or due to the respondents’ failure to appear. In the meantime the court sent inquiries to various State agencies for information about the respondents’ place of registration. 10. At the hearing of 13 December 2001 the applicant requested to change the names of the respondents, and the court repeatedly sent inquiries for information about their place of incorporation. 11. The next two hearings were cancelled due to the respondent’s default in appearance and because of the judge’s involvement in different proceedings. 12. At the hearing of 8 April 2002, following lack of information about the respondents’ exact whereabouts, the court suggested that the applicant notify them himself based on the information available to him. 13. At the hearing of 23 May 2002 the applicant relinquished his claims against one of the respondents and asked the court to invite a third party to join the proceedings. 14. On 7 August 2002 the applicant motioned to replace the initial respondents with a new set of five companies and specified his claims. On 11 September 2002 he relinquished his claims against one of the respondents. 15. The next three hearings were cancelled as the judge was involved in different proceedings. 16. The hearing of 1 November 2002 was postponed to allow a respondent to study the case. 17. The hearing of 10 November 2002 did not take place as the court did not have information about due notification of the respondents. 18. The next three hearings took place as scheduled. 19. On 9 December 2002 the court accepted the applicant’s relinquishment of his claim against two respondents and severed his claims against two other respondents into a separate case to avoid delay in the proceedings. By a judgment of the same date the District Court dismissed his claims against the remaining respondent. 20. On 16 December 2002 the applicant filed preliminary grounds of appeal and specified that he would submit reasoned grounds of appeal upon receipt of the reasoned judgment. On the same day the District Court left the appeal without consideration for failure to substantiate it and suggested that the applicant remedy this defect until 30 December 2002. 21. The applicant submitted copies of his complaints concerning failure of the District Court to produce the final text of the judgment of 9 December 2002 to the Zamoskvoretskiy District prosecutor’s office of 14 August 2003, to the appeal court of 8 September 2003 and 30 September 2004 and to the Judicial Qualifications Board of 8 April 2004. According to the applicant, in May and June he came to see the judge in his case, inquiring about the date of filing of the final text of the judgment at the registry. 22. The applicant submitted a copy of the cover of the case file with a handwritten note by a member of the court’s registry according to which he had received a copy of the judgment on 23 June 2005. 23. On 29 June 2005 the applicant submitted reasoned grounds of appeal of the judgment of 9 December 2002. The heading of the document includes a mention that the final text of the judgment had been obtained by the claimant on 23 June 2005. 24. On 30 June 2005 the District Court returned the applicant’s appeal as submitted outside the procedural time-limit. This decision was set aside by the appeal court on 27 October 2005. The court did not give any reasons for its decision. 25. On 14 March 2006 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment of 9 December 2002 on appeal. 26. Article 199 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Russia (in force since 14 November 2002) provides that drafting of the final reasoned text of the judgment may be postponed for no longer than five days after termination of the proceedings in the case.",1,763
155,155,"The applicant, Mr Rumen Ivanov Todorov, is a Bulgarian national who was born in 1960 and lives in Ahtopol. He was represented by Mr M. Ekimdjiev, a lawyer practising in Plovdiv. The respondent Government were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Karadjova, of the Ministry of Justice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 11 May 1990 the applicant obtained construction rights over a plot of municipal land in Rezovo, the municipality of Tsarevo (formerly Michurin). In accordance with the relevant law as in force at the time, the municipal authorities issued an order granting construction rights and also entered into a contract with the applicant. The surface of the plot was 700 square metres. The price was set at 700 “old” Bulgarian levs (BGL), which the applicant paid on 14 May 1990. At that time BGL 700 was the equivalent of approximately three average monthly salaries in the country. The contract stipulated, inter alia, that the applicant’s right to construct a building would expire in the event of his failing to complete the building within five years. The applicant hired an architect and on 19 July 1991 he obtained a building permit for a two-storey house of 111 square metres to be constructed on the plot. The applicant also purchased construction material, transported it to Rezovo and stored it there. On an unspecified date in the summer of 1991 the municipal building authorities refused to authorise the commencement of the construction works as the technician who had visited the site had noted that a high-voltage electricity conduit passed over the plot. It appears that during the same period persons claiming rights over neighbouring plots obstructed the applicant’s preparations for the construction of his house. In 1992 the applicant brought an action against them, seeking damages. The municipality of Tsarevo was summoned as a third party. By judgment of 2 March 1993 the Bourgas District Court dismissed the applicant’s claim against the neighbours, noting that the impossibility for the applicant to realise his project was only imputable to the municipality which had sold him construction rights over the plot in disregard of the fact that constructing a building there was not allowed owing to the passage of a high-voltage electricity conduit. On an unspecified date in 1993 the applicant wrote to the municipality asking them to provide him with another plot. He allegedly received assurances that that would be done later. By decision of 1 September 1995 the local land commission ordered the restitution of the land on which the applicant had obtained construction rights to the heirs of the person who had owned it prior to the collectivisation of agricultural land in Bulgaria in the 1950s. In October 1995 the applicant travelled to Germany and started working there. On 29 January 1996 the mayor of Tsarevo issued an order cancelling the applicant’s construction rights. On an unspecified date in 1997 the applicant brought an action against the municipality of Tsarevo seeking restitution of the price paid by him under the 1990 contract and damages for breach of contract. Initially he claimed BGL 100,000. On 31 March 1998 he increased the claim to BGL 1,000,000. By a judgment of 27 July 1998 the Tsarevo District Court partially granted the claim. On an appeal by the applicant, on 24 March 1999 the Bourgas Regional Court increased the award. The final judgment was that of the Supreme Court of Cassation of 15 May 2000, which upheld the Regional Court’s judgment. The courts found, inter alia, that the Tsarevo municipality had breached the 1990 contract with the applicant in that it had granted him construction rights over a plot which could not be built over and had failed to remedy that situation despite his complaints. It followed that the municipality was liable to pay all ensuing damages. The applicant had proven the alleged losses in respect of the price paid by him in May 1990 to the municipality (BGL 700), the architect’s fees paid by him in 1991 (BGL 1,200) and the expenses incurred by him in 1991 for the transport of construction material (BGL 8,000). The remainder of his claims, which concerned alleged loss of profits, were dismissed as unproven. The applicant had stated that in normal circumstances he would have completed the house within a year and would have rented it each year during the summer holidays. The courts found that the applicant had not substantiated the alleged loss of profits. He had relied solely on information about average property and rental prices at the relevant time. The amount awarded to the applicant was thus BGL 9,900 plus interest. Owing to the depreciation of the Bulgarian currency, by March 1999, when the award became enforceable, it represented, together with all interest accrued, the equivalent of not more than 15 euros (EUR). In his appeals before the Regional Court and the Supreme Court of Cassation the applicant protested that the courts had awarded him sums which had become worthless. He insisted that the award should be commensurate to the value of the actual damage he had sustained. In reply to those arguments the courts stated that in accordance with the relevant law and established practice the applicant was entitled to compensation for the actual damage suffered at the time when it was occasioned. In 2003 the applicant submitted a claim in which, in confused terms, he sought a declaration that the mayor’s order of 29 January 1996 was null and void and also requested compensation. The courts interpreted the claim as an action for a declaration of nullity and rejected it as unfounded by final decision of 18 June 2004.",0,947
161,161,"The applicant, Mr Jerzy Skotniczny, is an Austrian national who lives in Crakow. He is represented before the Court by Mr A. Buczkowski, a lawyer practising in Crakow. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 29 February 1994 the applicant brought an action before the Cracow-Śródmieście District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) claiming that joint ownership of a property located in Cracow at Grodzka Street, co-owned by him and two other persons, be dissolved. The proceedings were terminated by the decision of the Supreme Court of 10 July 2002. On 17 March 1999, the date on which the application was lodged with the Court, they were pending before the Cracow-Śródmieście District Court. On 17 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”) entered into force. It lays down various legal means designed to counteract and/or redress the undue length of judicial proceedings. Section 2 of the 2004 Act reads, in so far as relevant: Section 5 reads, in so far as relevant: “1. A complaint about the unreasonable length of proceedings shall be lodged while the proceedings are pending. ...” Section 12 provides for measures that may be applied by the court dealing with the complaint. It reads, in so far as relevant: “1. The court shall dismiss a complaint which is unjustified. 2. If the court considers that the complaint is justified, it shall find that there was an unreasonable delay in the impugned proceedings. 3. At the request of the complainant, the court may instruct the court examining the merits of the case to take certain measures within a fixed time-limit. Such instructions shall not concern the factual and legal assessment of the case. 4. If the complaint is justified the court may, at the request of the complainant, grant ... just satisfaction in an amount not exceeding PLN 10,000 to be paid by the State Treasury. If such just satisfaction is granted it shall be paid out of the budget of the court which conducted the delayed proceedings.” Section 18 lays down transitional rules in relation to the applications already pending before the Court. It reads, in so far as relevant: “1. Within six months after the date of entry into force of this law persons who, before that date, had lodged a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights ... complaining of a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time guaranteed by Article 6 (1) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ..., may lodge a complaint about the unreasonable length of the proceedings on the basis of the provisions of this law if their complaint to the Court had been lodged in the course of the impugned proceedings and if the Court has not adopted a decision concerning the admissibility of their case. ...” On 18 January 2005 Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) adopted a resolution (no. III SPP 113/04) in which it ruled that while the 2004 Act produced legal effects as from the date of its date of entry into force (17 September 2004), its provisions applied retroactively to all proceedings in which delays had occurred before that date and had not yet been remedied.",0,572
162,162,"The applicant is a British national living in Northern Ireland. She is represented before the Court by Messrs McClure and Company, a solicitors’ firm in Belfast The applicant is a social worker working with children under five years old. She also works on a voluntary basis as a classroom assistant in a local school. She is homosexual and her sexual orientation is known to her employer and to the school where she assists. The applicant has two children aged 11 and 12. The applicant has been involved in a homosexual relationship with L since 1990. L obtained a divorce in February 1993 but the custody and care of L’s four children (born in 1978, 1980, 1984 and 1986, respectively) were the subject of High Court proceedings. In or around December 1993 L and her former husband agreed interim shared care arrangements according to which the children would spend alternative weeks with each parent. On 10 May 1994 L and her former husband settled the High Court proceedings. L’s former husband would have custody of the children and her access to them would continue on the basis of the shared care arrangement. L also agreed that she would not permit the children to come into contact with or remain in the company of the applicant or of any other person known to L to be lesbian. The High Court made an order on the same day in the terms of this agreement. As a result of difficulties surrounding the applicant’s contact with L, the matter was brought before the High Court on 7 June 1995 when L again undertook to the Court that she would comply with the order of 10 May 1994. Following another summons issued by L’s former husband, on 25 January 1996 L undertook to the High Court that she would instruct the applicant not to call at her home at any time when she had access to the children, and she undertook not to answer or open the door if the applicant called at her house during a scheduled access visit. The High Court recorded L’s undertakings in its order of the same day and dismissed the summons. Since then L lives one week at her own address with her children and the other week with the applicant. During the course of the custody proceedings, social work and psychologist reports were submitted to the High Court dealing, inter alia, with the applicant’s position in relation to L and her children. The detailed report of a child and adolescent psychiatrist, Dr Gallagher, of September 1993 concluded that research showed there was no evidence that children living with lesbian mothers were adversely affected in terms of their sexual identity, personal development, peer relationships or social adjustment. He considered that there was no evidence that L’s sexual orientation posed a threat to the children or that L’s relationship with the applicant would adversely affect the children. The evidence was that cohabitation between L and the applicant, provided that relationship was good, would have a positive effect on the children. Given the acrimonious relationship between L and her former husband, the children’s need for stability and security, the difficulties L’s husband experienced with the shared care arrangements and since L was the main care giver, it was that expert’s opinion that L should be granted custody with frequent access being given to L’s former husband. A social work report of November 1992 indicated that there was nothing to suggest that L could not provide adequate care and protection for the children. Given the parents’ acrimonious relationship and the children’s need for stability, custody was recommended in favour of L with regular access in favour of L’s husband. A further social work report of June 1993 highlighted the husband’s concern about L’s relationship with the applicant. Having considered all of the care and custody options, the social worker indicated that he was unable to assess the children’s views on their mother’s homosexuality and that there was a lack of definitive research on the possible effects on the children’s developments of being in the custody of L who was homosexual. He found it extremely difficult to make a definite recommendation, but considered that custody should be given to L, her husband’s condition as regards the children having no contact with the applicant being considered “untenable”. Dr Harbinson, a consultant psychiatrist, did not agree with Dr Gallagher’s report of September 1993. In his report of November 1993, he considered that it was difficult to dismiss the vital importance of parents as role models for their children and the stigmatisation attached in our society to homosexuality. He considered that it would not be wise to raise the issue of L’s homosexuality with the children at that stage. Dr Gallagher produced an addendum to his report in December 1993 pointing out that Dr Harbinson had done limited research on lesbian couples and children and had misinterpreted the research quoted. He repeated that it was not the sexual orientation of parents that was the issue but rather the quality of the parents’ relationship. He added that psychological studies had shown that where the mother (the main care giver) was living with her lesbian partner, the mother was psychologically more secure and stable and this was, in turn, beneficial for the children. He confirmed his recommendation that L have custody of the children, with her husband having regular access.",0,901

On 23 February 1987 he submitted to the Prefecture of Athens an application for a disability pension under section 31 of Law no. 1543/85. 8. On the orders of the Prefecture an administrative inquiry was carried out by the Municipality of Moshato, which concluded on 15 December 1987 that the applicant was entitled to a pension because he had been tortured during the dictatorship and had suffered irreparable damage to his health as a result. 9. On 29 January 1988 the Health Committee of the Prefecture of Athens advised the General Accounting Office of the State (Geniko Logistirio tou Kratous) to grant the applicant a pension. The Health Committee considered that the applicant had been incarcerated because of his activities against the military dictatorship and had been tortured. As a result, his right hand was paralysed. 10. On 23 May 1988 the Pensions Regulatory Service (Ypiressia Kanonismou Syntaxeon) of the General Accounting Office rejected the applicant’s application on the ground that the conditions of section 31 of Law no. 1543/85 (see paragraph 19 below) were not fulfilled. The General Accounting Office considered that the applicant’s allegations were not proved by court decisions or public documents issued before 14 June 1984 and that the applicant had not been injured as a result either of his direct involvement in the struggle against the dictatorial regime or his opposition thereto. On 14 June 1988 the applicant appealed to the Audit Court (Elenktiko Synedrio). 11. The applicant’s appeal was heard by the Third Chamber of the Audit Court on 2 December 1988. It was rejected on 10 March 1989. The Third Chamber considered that the applicant’s allegations were not proven by a court decision or public document issued before 14 June 1984. It also found that the torturing of the applicant during the dictatorship had not resulted in an “injury” but in an “illness”. The law, however, provided for the award of a pension to persons who had been “injured” as a result of their opposition to the dictatorship. 12. On 17 April 1989 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Audit Court sitting in plenary, claiming that the Third Chamber had erred in law. 13. The Plenary held a hearing on 9 October 1991 at which the applicant did not appear. On 24 June 1992 the Audit Court decided that the applicant had not been duly summoned and adjourned the case. 14. Another hearing was held on 4 November 1992 at which the applicant was duly represented. On 26 May 1993 the Audit Court upheld the applicant’s appeal, on the ground, inter alia, that the Third Chamber had failed to examine in depth the cause of the paralysis of the applicant’s right hand. It sent the case back to its Third Chamber for reconsideration. 15. The Third Chamber held a hearing on 22 October 1993 at which the applicant was neither present nor represented. On 28 January 1994 it decided to adjourn the case. It ordered the applicant to produce within two months a number of decisions issued in the context of criminal proceedings against the applicant before 14 June 1984. It also sent the applicant’s file to the Health Committee of the Region of Attica ordering it to examine the applicant and to deliver an opinion on the following issues: Was the applicant’s paralysis the result of “injury” or “illness”? What was the extent of his disability? Was there any relationship between his disability and his activities during the dictatorship? 16. On 25 November 1994 the Health Committee considered that it could not deliver an opinion on the applicant’s case in the absence of any evidence that the applicant’s health condition was related to his activities during the dictatorship. On 29 March 1995 the applicant was informed of the Committee’s decision not to deliver an opinion. 17. On 6 October 1995 the Third Chamber of the Audit Court held a fresh hearing. 18. A further hearing was held on 29 November 1996. The Court has not been informed of any decision of the Third Chamber of the Audit Court. The Government state that judgment is to be delivered shortly. 19. Section 31 of Law no. 1543/85 provides the following: “All Greek citizens who were injured by or as a result of their direct involvement in the struggle against the dictatorial regime of 21 April 1967 to 23 July 1974 or as a result of their opposition to the above-mentioned regime are entitled to a pension paid by the State Treasury, provided that the above-mentioned circumstances have been recognised in a court decision based on public documents issued no later than 14 June 1984. ...” This provision does not create a right to a pension for persons who contracted an illness, as distinct from an injury, through their opposition to the dictatorship. Such a right was however created by a law of 1988 which is not relevant to the present case. 20. The award of a pension is not automatic but has to be applied for through the Prefecture to the Pensions Regulatory Service of the General Accounting Office. 21. An objection against the decision of the Pensions Regulatory Service can be brought before the Pensions Verification Board of the General Accounting Office (Article 66 of the Civilian and Military Pensions Code). An appeal lies within one year to a Chamber of the Audit Court (Article 48). A further appeal, on points of law, lies within one year (Articles 109 and 114) to the plenary Audit Court, which has the power to refer the case back to the competent Chamber (Article 116).",1,951
171,171,"7. The applicant company is a debt collector. In July 1999, it bought a defaulted State bond and sued the Government for the debt. After several years of litigation, on 10 April 2002 the Moscow City Commercial Court ordered the Government to pay the applicant company 100,000 American dollars (“USD”). 8. On 5 August 2002, the Appeals Division of the Moscow City Commercial Court upheld the judgment, but speciﬁed that the debt was to be paid by the Ministry of Finance. 9. On 6 November 2002, the ministry asked the court to stay the enforcement of the judgment until January 2003, because there were no funds in the State budget of 2002. 10. On 19 November 2002, bailiffs opened enforcement proceedings. 11. On 16 December 2002, the court refused to stay the enforcement because the ministry had failed to prove either that it did not have the funds, or that the funds would become available after January 2003. 12. On 7 February 2003, the ministry asked the court to stay the enforcement of the judgment until January 2004, because there were no funds in the State budget of 2003. 13. On 20 March 2003, the court refused to stay the enforcement because the ministry had failed to prove either that it did not have the funds, or that the funds would become available after January 2004. 14. In August 2003, the ministry asked the appeal court to clarify how the judgment was to be enforced. 15. On 3 September 2003, the appeal court clariﬁed that the judgment was to be enforced only once the applicant company had handed in the bond. The applicant company appealed against this decision because the general conditions of the bond’s issue did not require that it be handed in. In addition, the applicant company argued that the judgment could be enforced on the basis of a writ of enforcement alone, and that the bond was to be returned to the ministry only after the enforcement. On 25 November 2003, the Federal Commercial Court of the Moscow Circuit dismissed this appeal. 16. On 18 February 2004, the applicant company handed in the bond to the ministry. 17. Subsequently, the applicant company unsuccessfully sought an injunction to oblige the ministry to enforce the judgment.",1,377
176,176,"5. The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Maykop, the Republic of Adygeya. 6. The applicant is a businessman. In 1996 he purchased a saw-mill with the intention of operating it as a going concern. 7. In March 1998 the local authority ordered him to shut the saw-mill down because it was situated in the vicinity of sewage disposal installations and threatened the town's sanitation. 8. The applicant brought proceedings against the Maykop municipal maintenance company (муниципальное жилищно-коммунальное хозяйство города Майкопа) and the Maykop municipal water supply company (муниципальное унитарное предприятие «Водоканал», hereinafter “the water supply company”), in which he sought an order requiring them to lift the ban on the operation of the saw-mill and damages. 9. On 17 December 1999 the Maykop Town Court of the Republic of Adygeya ordered the water supply company not to prevent the applicant from carrying on his activity. The judgment was not appealed against and became final. 10. However, it was not enforced. Instead, the water supply company blocked the road leading to the saw-mill and switched off the electricity supply. 11. The applicant was not issued with a warrant of execution until 28 April 2002 pending a decision in another case in which a third party was trying to challenge his title to the saw-mill. 12. On 14 May 2002 the enforcement proceedings were set in motion. 13. Three months later the bailiff suspended the enforcement proceedings and applied for clarification of the judgment of 17 December 1999. 14. On 29 October 2002 the Maykop Town Court held that the judgment of 17 December 1999 had to be enforced exactly as it was worded. 15. On 8 January 2003 the bailiff brought the enforcement proceedings to an end. However, the access road remained blocked and the electricity supply was not restored. 16. The applicant appealed against the decision to discontinue the enforcement proceedings. 17. On 21 February 2003 the Maykop Town Court quashed that decision. 18. On 25 March 2003 the Supreme Court of the Republic of Adygeya upheld the above judgment on appeal. 19. On 13 January 2006 the enforcement proceedings were resumed. 20. On 18 January 2006 the director of the water supply company issued access passes to the applicant and his nominees. 21. On 19 January 2006 free access to the saw-mill was restored, and the obstacles preventing the applicant from using it were removed. He was invited to collect the passes, but failed to do so. When the bailiffs went to the applicant's home to serve him with papers concerning the enforcement, they were unable to find him, but were met instead by his father, who refused to look at the papers and explained that the applicant had moved to another city. 22. On 26 January 2006 the enforcement proceedings were discontinued. The applicant did not appeal against that decision.",1,475
177,177,"The applicants, Mr Saydam Hüsnü Baybora, Mr Hüsnü Mullaz Fevzi Baybora, Mrs Radiye Baybora, Mr Selçuk Baybora, Mr Gültekin Baybora and Mrs Aydaner Gökçen. They were born in 1940, 1913, 1918, 1944, 1947 and 1950 respectively and live in Ertenköy (Kokkina), Cyprus. They are represented before the Court by Mr Z. Necatigil and Ms S. Karabacak, lawyers practising in Turkey. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows. The first applicant was living in Erenköy (Kokkina), Cyprus, when he was abducted on 1 January 1964 by forces under the control and/or the responsibility of the respondent Government. The second and third applicants are the father and the mother of the first applicant. The other applicants are his brothers and sister. The applicants submit that in 1964 their village had run out of food supplies because hostilities between the two communities had prevented any form of safe transportation of food. On 1 January 1964 the first applicant, together with his friend, Lütfi Celul Karabardak, who owned a bus, took this bus and headed towards the Turkish-Cypriot town of Lefke. On the way, whilst passing through the Greek-Cypriot village of Pyrgos, he and his friend were abducted by a group of armed Greek-Cypriots, including a police officer, and taken to an unknown destination. They were never heard of again. The persistent efforts of the relatives to ascertain the fate of the missing persons were in vain. Subsequently, on 4 April 1989, the first applicant’s case was submitted to the appropriate authority on missing persons, the United Nations Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus (“CMP”) (case number 146). According to the personal diary of a certain Georghiou Luca, a teacher from the Greek-Cypriot village of Mosphileri, which was found in the possession of a Turkish-Cypriot journalist, the missing persons were “executed” summarily in the Greek-Cypriot cemetery of Pyrgos village by armed Greek Cypriots named Mouzouri and Pari “on the instructions of the Headquarters” (the code-name of the then Minister of Interior, Polycarpos Georghadjis). Through the intermediary of the Turkish-Cypriot member of the CMP, the relatives submitted this additional information to the CMP in the hope of finding out what really happened to the missing persons. According to the applicants, a number of requests were made to the CMP to conduct an effective investigation into the fate of the first applicant and his friend. However, there was no response to their requests and no hint of any effective investigation having been undertaken. The third applicant wrote to Amnesty International in London. He stated in his letter that all of their enquiries had so far borne no results and that the Greek-Cypriot Administration had persistently refused to investigate the matter. Amnesty International answered by saying that it appeared that while the CMP may have investigated quite a number of cases submitted to it, it has not been able to bring any of these investigations to a conclusion because the Committee members have been unable to come to an agreement about the Committee’s working methods. The accidental discovery of human remains in 1996 in the Kato Pyrgos region raised a hope for the applicants. However, a scientific report drafted by an American company, following the study of a bone sample, concluded that the individuals whose remains had been found had lived between 1030 and 1240 AD. On 2 March 2001 the Office of the Greek Cypriot Member of the CMP sent to the CMP the following letter: “I am referring to the human remains which were accidentally discovered four years ago in Kato Pyrgos. My letter dated 10.12.1999, as well as your letter dated 14.4.2000 on this issue, are hereby appended for any reference. Further to a conversation you had with Mr Georgiades concerning recent developments on the matter, I wish to inform you that on two separate occasions, members of the team of the Physicians for Human Rights, assisted by our investigating officer and myself, searched the area for additional skeletal remains. All remains were subsequently taken to the laboratory of the Physicians for Human Rights in Cyprus for anthropological analysis, and for decent keeping. Moreover, skeletal samples were sent to a laboratory in U.S. for specialised tests in order to ascertain the period that the remains were buried. The report of the laboratory concerning the remains is appended, as well as a letter by Dr W. Hagkund Director PHR Cyprus Project. We would be most grateful if you could inform accordingly the Office of the Turkish Cypriot Member of the CMP of this development. We strongly suggest that the Turkish Cypriot family, which claimed in the press that the remains might belong to their missing father, should also be informed of the results of the scientific analysis by you too. We are at your entire disposal for any further information ...”.",0,804
178,178,"8. The applicant is the owner of an apartment in Milan, which he had let to S.P. 9. In a registered letter of 28 June 1988, the applicant informed the tenant that he intended to terminate the lease on expiry of the term on 1 July 1988 and asked her to vacate the premises by that date. 10. In a writ served on the tenant on 20 February 1991, the applicant reiterated his intention to terminate the lease and summoned the tenant to appear before the Milan Magistrate. 11. By a decision of 14 March 1991, which was made enforceable on 27 March 1991, the Milan Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 31 December 1992. 12. On 30 November 1992, the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring her to vacate the premises. On an unidentified date, he served notice on the tenant informing her that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 19 February 1993. 13. On 3 December 1993, the applicant made a statutory declaration that he urgently required the premises as accommodation for his mother. 14. Between 19 February 1993 and 12 May 1997 the bailiff made twenty attempts to recover possession. Each attempt proved unsuccessful, as the applicant was never granted the assistance of the police in enforcing the order for possession. 15. On 31 August 1997, the applicant repossessed the apartment. 16. The relevant domestic law is described in the Court’s judgment in the case of Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, §§ 18-35, ECHR 1999-V.",0,267
180,180,"The applicant, Mr Walter Meischberger, is an Austrian national, who was born in 1959 and lives in Vienna. He is represented before the Court by Mr J. Hintermayr, a lawyer practising in Linz. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 13 October 1994 the Innsbruck Public Prosecutor’s Office opened preliminary proceedings against N.M. on suspicion of tax evasion. On 28 October 1994 the Innsbruck Regional Court (Landesgericht) extended these proceedings to four other suspects including the applicant. He was suspected of having, in June 1994, as the representative of football player P.S., incited N.M. who was then the president of the Tirol Football Club to declare P.S.’s salary at a relatively low level and to pay him 3 million Austrian schillings (ATS) without declaring them, thus, avoiding salary tax to be paid. The applicant was represented by counsel in these and the subsequent proceedings. Also on 28 October 1994, the Public Prosecutor requested the Regional Finance Directorate (Finanzlandesdirektion) to investigate the case. On 6 February 1995 the Regional Finance Directorate, after having questioned the applicant as a suspect, submitted the minutes. Subsequently, after having carried out tax assessment proceedings concerning the Tirol Football Club, it submitted an interim report on its investigations. On 28 November 1995, the Regional Finance Directorate submitted its final investigation report. On 12 February 1996 the investigating judge summoned the applicant as a suspect to appear on 27 February 1996 for questioning. Upon the applicant’s request the hearing was postponed to 1 March. The applicant did not appear and the questioning took place a week later, on 8 March 1996. Meanwhile, the investigating judge had requested the Vienna Regional Criminal Court to question two witnesses by way of judicial assistance. On 3 June 1996 the Vienna Regional Court returned the file to the Innsbruck Regional Court, which submitted it to the Public Prosecutor on the following day. On 12 June 1996 the Public Prosecutor requested the Regional Tax Office to submit further information, which it did on 3 July. On 23 July 1996 the preliminary investigations against N.M. were extended to include a further charge. N.M. unsuccessfully appealed against this decision. On 6 December 1996 the indictment against the applicant and four coaccused was preferred. The applicant was charged with aiding and abetting salary tax evasion contrary to sections 11 and 33 § 2 (b) of the Tax Offences Act (Finanzstrafgesetz). On 28 January 1997 the Innsbruck Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) dismissed the applicant’s objection (Einspruch) against the indictment. On 10 February 1997 the presiding judge fixed 6 May as date for the trial. On 12 February 1997 the applicant and one of his co-accused requested that the proceedings be transferred to the Vienna Regional Criminal Court. Thereupon, the trial scheduled for 6 May 1997 was cancelled. On 16 April 1997 the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof) dismissed the request for transfer. On 5 August 1997 the Innsbruck Regional Court held the trial against the applicant and his co-accused. The applicant pleaded not guilty. The Public Prosecutor submitted an expert opinion concerning questions of tax law and a number of witnesses were heard. Further, the applicant submitted an expert opinion on questions of tax law. At the close of the hearing the court convicted the applicant of aiding and abetting salary tax evasion contrary to sections 11 and 33 § 2 (b) of the Tax Offences Act and imposed a fine of ATS 500,000 on him, part of which was suspended on probation. On 10 October 1997 the applicant filed a request for rectification of the trial minutes. On 20 October 1997 the Innsbruck Regional Court partly granted the applicant’s request and made a number of additions to the minutes. On 29 October 1997 the written version of the Innsbruck Regional Court’s judgment of 5 August was served on the applicant. On 30 October 1997 the applicant filed a second request for rectification of the minutes, which remained unsuccessful. On 26 November 1997 the applicant filed a plea of nullity and an appeal. On 23 February 1998 the applicant, represented by a second counsel, supplemented his plea of nullity. On 16 December 1998 the Supreme Court held a hearing and dismissed the applicant’s and his co-accused’s pleas of nullity and their appeals. The Supreme Court noted at the outset that one of the applicant’s coaccused had complained that section 33 § 2 (b) of the Tax Offences Act referred to provisions of the Income Tax Act 1972 and was, thus, no longer applicable at the time of the offences, as meanwhile the Income Tax Act 1988 had entered into force. It observed that if this assertion was correct it would affect the convictions of all five co-accused. However, the Supreme Court found that section 33 § 2 (b) of the Tax Offences Act contained a so-called dynamic reference, i.e. at any given time it referred to the Income Tax in the version in force at that time. Moreover, it had to be read in conjunction with section 111 of the Income Tax Act 1988 according to which the provisions of that Act replaced the corresponding provisions of the Income Tax Act 1972 referred to in any other law. Thus, the legal basis for all co-accused’s conviction was sufficiently clear. The Supreme Court’s decision was served on the applicant on 1 February 1999.",0,894
181,181,"4. The applicants were born in 1924, 1932, 1940, 1949, 1946, 1944, 1937 and 1934 respectively and live in different cities in Turkey. 5. On various dates, the applicants inherited or bought plots of land and properties near the coasts in different parts of Turkey, namely in Çanakkale, Şarköy, Izmir, Mudanya and Seferihisar. Some of the applicants constructed houses or operated commercial entities on their land. 6. On different dates, the Treasury requested from the competent courts of first instance to determine whether the applicants’ properties were located within the coastal strip. A group of experts appointed by the courts inspected the plots of land and any existing buildings on them and concluded that they were located within the coastline area. 7. Following the conclusion of the expert reports, the Treasury brought actions before the relevant courts, requesting the annulment of the applicants’ title deeds to the land and the properties, on the ground that they were located within the coastal area. 8. On various dates, the courts of first instance upheld the request of the Treasury and annulled in full the applicants’ title deeds in application nos. 23953/05, 37166/05, 19638/06 and 17654/07, whereas the title deeds in the remaining two applications were partially annulled. In their decisions, the courts held that, pursuant to domestic law (the Coastal Law of 1990), the coasts could not be subject to private ownership and that, therefore, the applicants could not rely on the argument that they had acted bona fides or on the fact that they had constructed buildings on the plots of land. 9. Appeals by the applicants against these judgments were dismissed by the Court of Cassation. Some of the applicants’ requests for rectification of the judgments were also rejected by that court. 10. In application no. 23953/05 the applicant brought an action for damages in the Şarköy Civil Court of First Instance on account of his loss of ownership and the demolition of four shops located on the land. On 28 October 2003 the Şarköy Civil Court of First Instance dismissed the applicant’s action on the ground that, inter alia, the State was not liable for the damage resulting from the cancellation of the registration of the property in issue. The applicant appealed. In a judgment of 24 September 2004 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment. A rectification request by the applicant was further dismissed by the Court of Cassation on 17 March 2005. The details concerning the six applications are indicated in the table below:  11. The relevant domestic law and practice in force at the material time are outlined in the Doğrusöz and Aslan v. Turkey judgment (no. 1262/02, § 16, 30 May 2006).",1,447
183,183,"4. The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Rimavská Baňa. 5. The applicant's father was a member of an agricultural co-operative. He died in 1995. 6. The cooperative underwent a transformation and a monetary value of the membership interests of individual members was established. In a decree of 4 September 1998 the co-operative certified the financial value of the ownership interest that had once belonged to the applicant's father. 7. The applicant subsequently made a claim for compensation in respect of his father's membership interest (see below). 8. On 3 March 1998 the Banská Bystrica Regional Court declared the co-operative insolvent. 9. On 25 June 1998 the applicant registered his compensation claim in the insolvency proceedings. 10. On 18 May 1999 the regional court held a hearing (prieskumné pojednávanie) with a view to establishing the claims of the different creditors. At the hearing the receiver rejected the applicant's claim on the ground that he had filed it in his own name but had failed formally to show that the claim, which had originally belonged to his father, had actually devolved on him. The applicant was referred to the possibility of seeking judicial establishment of his claim by way of a separate action (incidenčná žaloba). The applicant brought such an action and was successful (see below). 11. In the following period, the regional court agreed to the sale of the co-operative's individual assets. 12. On 1 December 2005 a final report on the sale of the co-operative's assets was submitted to the regional court. It was amended on 14 March 2006 and displayed on the regional court's official notice board on 6 March 2007. 13. On 4 April 2007 a hearing took place. On 18 October 2007 a meeting of the insolvency creditors took place and a new receiver was appointed. 14. On 21 June 2010 the applicant informed the Court that the insolvency proceedings were still pending. 15. On 1 June 1999 the applicant brought an action against the insolvency receiver in the regional court seeking judicial establishment of his compensation claim. 16. On 30 April 2002 the regional court granted the action and decided that the applicant had a claim in an amount equivalent to 18,537 euros. The applicant alleged that the judgment had not been served on him but on his daughter and therefore had not yet become final. 17. The Government stated that the judgment had become final on 3 July 2002. 18. On 8 July 2003 the applicant lodged a complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution with the Constitutional Court in respect of the length of the insolvency proceedings and the proceedings in the action for establishment of his claim. 19. On 10 September 2003 the Constitutional Court declared the complaint inadmissible. As for the proceedings in the applicant's action, it observed that they had ended in 2002. They had thus no longer been pending at the time when the constitutional complaint had been lodged. In these circumstances, in line with the Constitutional Court's established practice, the complaint of the length of those proceedings was manifestly illfounded. As for the insolvency proceedings, the Constitutional Court observed that the sale of the co-operative's assets was still under way and had not yet been completed. As the Constitutional Court had not found any undue delays, it concluded that the complaint in respect of the insolvency proceedings was manifestly ill-founded.",1,564
184,184,"4. The applicant was born in 1941 and lives in the town of Krasnyy Luch, Lugansk region, Ukraine. 5. In 2003 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Krasnolutskyy Town Court against her former employer, the Knyagyninska State Mining Company (Шахта «Княгинінська» ДХК «Донбасантрацит»), for salary arrears and compensation for moral damage. On 29 October 2003 the court awarded the applicant 2,479.19 Ukrainian hryvnias (“UAH”) (Рішення Краснолуцького міського суду Луганської області). 6. In December 2003 the Krasnolutskyy Town Bailiffs' Service (Міський відділ Державної виконавчої служби Красно луцького міського управління юстиції) initiated the enforcement proceedings. 7. By letter of 2 June 2004, the Bailiffs' Service informed the applicant that the debtor's accounts had been seized but that it was impossible to deal in the debtor's property because the debtor was a State enterprise. 8. On 25 March 2005 the Lugansk Regional Commercial Court initiated bankruptcy proceedings against the debtor enterprise. 9. The applicant received UAH 1,386.34; according to the applicant, the rest of the debt remains unpaid. 10. The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-18, 27 July 2004).",1,186
187,187,"The applicant, a stateless person, was born in Bulgaria in 1939. Before the Court he is represented by Mr Henrik Olsson, a lawyer practising in Stockholm. The applicant moved to Sweden from Bulgaria in 1965. Since more than eight years, he is married to a Swedish national, A.S. He also has a 23 year old daughter who lives in Sweden. As from 1968 the applicant has been convicted on many occasions for serious and repeated crimes, inter alia crimes against property, including robbery, as well as smuggling of goods and narcotics offences of an aggravated nature. He has been sentenced to the following terms of imprisonment: 1972 - 2 years, 1974 - 2 years, 1977 - 7 years, 1980 3 years, 1985 - 5 years. He was released on probation on 27 February 1991. At that time, 2 years and 10 months of his sentences had not been served. The applicant’s expulsion from Sweden was ordered in 1972 and 1980. However, by a Government decision of 29 April 1982, the expulsion orders were revoked by pardon as the applicant risked political persecution in Bulgaria. Having regard to that decision, the District Court (tingsrätten) of Huddinge, in its 1985 judgment, refrained from ordering the applicant’s expulsion. In May 1992 the applicant was charged with having possessed and stored, with the intention to sell, 389 grams of amphetamine in April 1992. However, on 25 May 1992, the District Court of Huddinge acquitted the applicant. By a judgment of 8 June 1993 the District Court of Nacka convicted the applicant for two narcotics offences, one of which was considered as aggravated, illegal possession of a weapon and falsification of a passport. All the crimes had been committed in March 1993. The more serious narcotics offence involved the possession and storage, with the intention to sell, about 5 kilograms of amphetamine. The applicant was sentenced to six years in prison. Further, the court ordered his expulsion from Sweden and issued a prohibition on his return. When fixing the applicant’s prison sentence, the court had regard to the detriment suffered by him on account of the expulsion. The public prosecutor appealed against the Huddinge District Court judgment and the applicant appealed against the Nacka District Court judgment. The Svea Court of Appeal (Svea hovrätt) joined the two cases and gave judgment on 12 August 1993. Reversing the judgment of the District Court of Huddinge, it found the applicant guilty of the narcotics offence committed in April 1992. It upheld the judgment of the District Court of Nacka in regard to the finding of guilt, the expulsion order and the prohibition on return. Having regard to the expulsion order, it sentenced the applicant to a total of seven years’ imprisonment. On 15 September 1993 the Supreme Court (Högsta domstolen) refused the applicant leave to appeal. In 1994, at his own request, the applicant lost his Bulgarian citizenship. According to a medical certificate issued on 22 January 1996 by S.A., a licensed psychologist at Hall Prison, the applicant had mental problems due to the expulsion order and had expressed the intention not to commit any crimes in the future. S.A. expressed that, with increased age, criminal activities tend to decrease. On several occasions thereafter the applicant requested the Government to exercise its power under Chapter 7, Section 16 of the Aliens Act to annul the expulsion order. All his requests were denied. The last decision was taken by the Government on 2 July 1998. The applicant was released on probation on 4 October 1997 and was expelled from Sweden on 30 June 1998. His wife left Sweden and joined him soon thereafter. ",0,605

After the death of her daughter, her son-in-law, P.V., did not allow her to see P.E. 6. On 10 January 1997 the applicant instituted proceedings against P.V., seeking permission to see her granddaughter regularly. 7. On 3 December 1999 the Ordzhonikidzevsky District Court of Kharkiv (hereafter “the Ordzhonikidzevsky Court”) allowed the applicant's claim in part. 8. On 18 January 2000 the Kharkiv Regional Court quashed this decision and remitted the case for a fresh consideration. 9. On 7 July 2000 Ordzhonikidzevsky Court found against the applicant. 10. On 5 September 2000 the Kharkiv Regional Court quashed this decision and remitted the case for a fresh consideration. 11. On 20 June 2001 the Frunzensky District Court of Kharkiv allowed the applicant's claim in part. 12. On 9 January 2002 the Kharkiv Regional Court of Appeal quashed this decision and terminated the proceedings and left the applicant's claim without consideration as she had not used the possibility of extrajudicial settlement of the dispute before the Tutelage Board. The applicant was informed that she could re-lodge her claim after exhausting this possibility. 13. On 14 August 2002 the Supreme Court upheld the ruling of the Kharkiv Regional Court of Appeal, thereby terminating the proceedings. The applicant received the copy of this ruling by regular mail on 7 October 2002.",1,240
190,190,"The applicants are Polish nationals. The first applicant was born in 1942, the second applicant was born in 1950. They both live in Warsaw. They are represented before the Court by Mr Ireneusz Zieliński, a lawyer practising in Warsaw. A. s, may be summarised as follows: The applicants are two businessmen running a non-commercial partnership (spółka cywilna). On an unspecified date in 1993 a trustee of an estate of a certain insolvent company sued the applicants in the Rzeszów Regional Court (Commercial Division) (Sąd Wojewódzki - Wydział Gospodarczy) for payment of a debt. On a further unspecified date the applicants filed a counter-claim. On 9 June 1994 the court held a hearing. During the hearing the applicants requested the court to fix a new hearing date for the end of the fruit season. The court granted their request and listed the next hearing for 8 September 1994, which was duly recorded in the minutes. Subsequently, during the same hearing, the applicants also requested the court to synchronise this hearing with a hearing before the same court, which was to be held in another case to which the applicants were parties. On 8 September 1994 the applicants were not present at the hearing as they considered that a summons should be served on them in order to confirm the hearing date. On 22 September 1994 the court gave judgment ordering the applicants to pay the sum sought by the plaintiff. It rejected their counter-claim. A copy of the judgment was not served on the applicants. They became aware of the judgment and its content as late as 11 October 1994. On this date they filed an appeal and a request to grant them retrospective leave to appeal out of time. They submitted that, to their understanding, on 9 June 1994 the court had not definitely fixed a new hearing date and therefore they had waited for a formal notification. The applicants also requested the court to rectify the minutes of the hearing of 9 June 1994 by inserting the following paragraph: “The court revises its order concerning the date of the next hearing and it will fix the date ex officio, synchronising it with a hearing in a case no. ... . The court shall notify the parties of that date.” On 29 November 1994 the Rzeszów Regional Court dismissed the applicants' request for leave to appeal out of time. The court found that the minutes of the hearing had unambiguously indicated that the date of the next hearing had been fixed for 8 September 1994 and the court had correctly considered that the applicants had been duly notified of the hearing. The court also took into account the fact that the plaintiff had had no doubts as to the date of the hearing in question. Moreover, the applicants had been represented by a lawyer and any potential misunderstanding could have not been considered as a plausible justification for their failure to appeal within the prescribed time-limit. The applicants appealed against this decision. On 28 April 1995 the Rzeszów Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) upheld the contested decision. The court observed that a party to the proceedings was expected to act with all due diligence and if the applicants had had any doubts as to the definite hearing date, they could easily have verified them. On 28 February 1995 a single judge, sitting as the Rzeszów Regional Court dismissed the applicants' request to rectify the minutes of the hearing. The court based its decision on the same grounds as those contained in the decision dismissing the applicants' request for leave to appeal out of time. On 10 April 1995 the applicants' further appeal was dismissed by the same court, sitting as a panel of three judges. Subsequently, the applicants unsuccessfully requested the Minister of Justice for leave to file an extraordinary appeal. In letters of 19 January 1995 and of 17 March 1995 the Minister informed them that he would not examine the requests as both the proceedings concerning their request for leave to appeal out of time and the proceedings relating to their request for rectification of the minutes were still pending. In a letter of 31 October 1995 the Minister informed them that he could not rule on their request for leave to file an extraordinary appeal in respect of the judgment of 22 September 1994 because such a leave could not be granted in a commercial case after the expiry of six months from the date on which the judgment had become final. In respect of the second decision, the Minister found that there was no basis for granting the applicants leave to file an extraordinary appeal. B. Relevant domestic law and practice Section 149 § 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads, insofar as relevant: “The parties and the [other] persons concerned shall be notified of a hearing date; such notification is effected either by service of a summons or [in case of an adjournment of a hearing] by fixing a date during the hearing. A summons shall always be served on the party which has been absent at the hearing ... .” Section 168 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads, insofar as relevant: “If the party to proceedings fails to comply with the prescribed time-limit without its fault, the court shall, on that party's request, grant leave to appeal out of time ... .”",0,902
191,191,"The applicant, Mr Józef Szyc, is a Polish citizen who was born in 1950 and is currently detained in Biała Podlaska Prison. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 21 November 1990 the applicant was imprisoned in Biała Podlaska Prison. Subsequently, he was many times transferred between prisons in Włodawa, Biała Podlaska, Siedlce, Kamińsk and Chełm. On 23 July 2009 the applicant was released from Chełm Prison as he had been granted a leave on compassionate grounds. On 20 July 2010 the applicant resumed serving his prison sentence. He is currently detained in Biała Podlaska Prison. The applicant submitted that practically all prisons in which he had been detained from 1999 or 2000 onwards had been overcrowded. By way of an example, he submitted that in June 2008 he had been detained in a prison cell with a living space of approx. 1 m² per inmate. He moreover asserted that on one occasion, for a period of one week, he was forced to sleep on a mattress on the cell floor. The overcrowding had resulted in tension and conflict among the detainees as well as in the progressive deterioration of the prison’s sanitary conditions. The applicant further submitted that from November 1995 and over the next 13 years, he had been detained together with smokers, despite his being a non-smoker. The cells in which he had been detained had no proper ventilation. As regards the applicant’s detention in Włodawa Prison, the Government pointed out that prior to 2 January 1999 the prison authorities had not been storing information as to the exact number of prisoners detained in each cell on specific dates. They further submitted that, to their general knowledge, the problem of overcrowding had not existed in Włodawa Prison prior to 1999. The Government acknowledged that from January 1999 until May 2003 the applicant had been temporarily placed in cells with a living space ranging from 2.5 m2 to 3.49 m2 per prisoner. The total time in which the applicant was imprisoned in cells of less than 3 m² per prisoner amounted to at least 145 days. The Government explained that during his entire stay in Włodawa Prison the applicant had been detained only in non-smoking cells. As for the applicant’s detention in prisons in Chełm and in Siedlce, the Government acknowledged that both these penitentiary centres had been permanently overcrowded at the relevant time. The applicant had been imprisoned in cells of less than 3 m² per prisoner for an overall period of 835 days. On one occasion, due to lack of space, the applicant was required to sleep on a double mattress on the cell floor for nine days. During an unspecified time the applicant was detained together with smokers, but he never complained to the authorities about this fact. In Biała Podlaska Prison the applicant was incarcerated in cells with a living space ranging from 2 m2 to 4.1 m2 per prisoner. The total period during which he was detained in cells of less than 3 m² per prisoner amounted to 744 days. The Government explained that in Biała Podlaska Prison the applicant had been serving his sentence in a semi-open ward where cells remained open during daytime. Moreover, from November 2006 to August 2007 he had been allowed to take a bath on a daily basis. Lastly, they submitted that, on three occasions, the applicant had been granted a temporary, accompanied release from prison. He was also granted leave to attend his father’s funeral without being accompanied by a prison officer. More recently, the applicant submitted that the living conditions in Biała Podlaska Prison were inadequate and that he was detained together with four other inmates in cell no. 139 which was designed for three persons. The applicant informed the Court that on unspecified dates in 2003 and 2004 he brought several civil actions against prisons in Włodawa, Siedlce and Chełm for the infringement of his personal rights. He briefly informed the Court that his claims had been unsuccessful but failed to provide details about the exact course or the outcome of any of the proceedings. The Government submitted that the applicant’s civil action against Włodawa Prison had been dismissed by a decision of the first-instance court against which the applicant did not appeal. Three other civil actions which the applicant had attempted to institute before the Siedlce Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) were all rejected for failure to comply with the prescribed procedural requirements. The Government further submitted that the applicant had instituted another civil action before the Lublin Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy). These proceedings were currently pending. The applicant did not contest the foregoing statements. A detailed description of the relevant domestic law and practice concerning general rules governing conditions of detention in Poland and domestic remedies available to detainees alleging that the conditions of their detention were inadequate are set out in the Court’s pilot judgments given in the cases of Orchowski v. Poland (no. 17885/04) and Norbert Sikorski v. Poland (no. 17599/05) on 22 October 2009 (see §§ 75-85 and §§ 45-88 respectively). More recent developments are described in the Court’s decision in the case of Łatak v. Poland (no. 52070/08) on 12 October 2010 (see §§ 25-54).",0,894
193,193,"The applicant, Benet Czech, spol. s r.o., is a limited liability company incorporated under Czech law with its registered seat in Prague. It was represented before the Court by Mr P. Klimeš, a lawyer practising in Prague. The respondent Government were represented by their Agent, Mr V.A. Schorm, from the Ministry of Justice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In April 2001 criminal proceedings were instituted against a former manager and sole shareholder of the applicant company on the suspicion of having committed tax evasion. Subsequently, prosecuting authorities seized the applicant company's financial and business documents which were, however, mixed with documents of other companies subjected to the investigation. According to the applicant company, the documents have never been returned to it. On 13 September 2001 the prosecuting authorities seized CZK 8,861,401.13 (EUR 319,942) and USD 41,677.80 (EUR 29,769) deposited on the applicant company's bank accounts on the suspicion that these assets might have constituted a profit from criminal activities of the manager. The applicant company says that it was not involved in any business transactions investigated by the police and that its former manager is prosecuted for acts which are not in any way related to the business pursued by the applicant company. The criminal proceedings are still pending. Meanwhile, numerous tax proceedings were brought against the applicant company in regard of the suspected retrenchment. They all were later discontinued as no tax evasion by the applicant company was detected. On 14 April 2005 the applicant company requested that the seizure be lifted. Its request was dismissed by the Prague High Prosecutor (vrchní státní zástupce) on 24 June 2005. The prosecutor found irrelevant the applicant company's objection that the tax proceedings brought against it had been discontinued. On 11 August 2005 the Prague High Court (vrchní soud) dismissed the applicant company's appeal. In its constitutional appeal, the applicant company claimed that the seizure of its assets was disproportionate due to its excessive length. On 9 March 2006 the Constitutional Court (Ústavní soud) declared the appeal inadmissible, finding that a fair balance between the general interest of the society and those of the applicant company arising from its fundamental rights had been struck. The decision was served on the applicant company's lawyer on 16 March 2006. On 9 October 2006 the High Prosecutor dismissed the applicant company's new request for partial lifting of the seizure. The High Court upheld this decision on 21 November 2006, but on 30 January 2008 the Constitutional Court quashed that decision finding a violation of the applicant company's right to property. It held that the length of the seizure, over six years, was unreasonable, which thus disrupted the fair balance between the general interest of fighting serious crime and the protection of the rights of the applicant company. On 11 March 2008 the High Prosecutor lifted fully the seizure of the applicant company's bank accounts.",0,489
194,194,"4. The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Geretsberg. 5. On 24 June 1999 the Braunau District Administrative Authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft) charged the applicant with drunken driving. The applicant, represented by counsel, submitted observations on 13 July and 8 September 1999. 6. On 21 September 1999 the District Administrative Authority issued a penal order (Straferkenntnis) finding the applicant guilty of drunken driving contrary to Sections 5 § 1 and 99 § 1 (a) of the Road Traffic Act (Strassenverkehrsordnung). As to the alcohol level the authority had regard to the results of a breathalyser test and to the corroborating results of a blood alcohol analysis carried out the following day. It imposed a fine of 16,000 Austrian schillings (approximately 1,160 euros) on him with 14 days' imprisonment in default. 7. The applicant appealed on 12 October 1999. 8. On 9 December 1999 the Upper Austria Independent Administrative Panel (Unabhängiger Verwaltungssenat) held a hearing at which it questioned the applicant and the two police officers who had carried out the breathalyser tests and a further witness. 9. By decision of 21 December 1999 the Independent Administrative Panel, having held a hearing, dismissed the applicant's appeal. It found that the applicant had driven his car on 15 June 1999 at 8 p.m. having a proportion of alcohol in his breath exceeding the statutory level. He admitted to having consumed alcohol in the afternoon. Having run out of petrol, the applicant had left the car and had gone to the next petrol station. Upon his return, he had been requested by two police officers to undergo breathalyser tests. The tests, carried out at 8.52 and 8.54 p.m. respectively, had yielded results of 0.84 and 0.86 mg alcohol/litres. The Independent Administrative Panel dismissed the applicant's request to take an expert opinion in order to show that the difference in these results was due to his having consumed one and a half litres of beer when he went to fetch petrol and that he had, before that, not been driving his car in a state of drunkenness. Having regard to the instructions for use of the breathalyser at issue, the Independent Administrative Panel noted that the difference in the two test results was not significant. 10. In any case, it found that the applicant's defence was not credible as he had stated at his first interrogation to have parked his car at 8 p.m. and had explicitly answered the police officers' question whether he had consumed alcohol after that in the negative. It was only in his written submissions of 13 July that he had claimed to have consumed more beer after 8 p.m. The bill submitted by the applicant did not support his defence as the innkeeper had stated that he had given the applicant this bill two weeks after the incident on his explicit request. He had not remembered the applicant and could not confirm whether he had actually consumed beer at his inn at the relevant time. 11. The applicant lodged a complaint with the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof) on 3 February 2000. He complained in particular about the refusal of his request to take an expert opinion. On 3 April 2000 the Independent Administrative Panel submitted observations in reply. The applicant made further submissions on 3 May and 21 June 2000. 12. On 7 August 2003 the Administrative Court, having deliberated on 4 July 2003, dismissed the applicant's complaint as being unfounded. It found in particular that the Independent Administrative Panel's assessment of evidence did not suffer from any defects and that it had given detailed and convincing reasons for its refusal to take the expert opinion requested by the applicant. 13. The decision was served on the applicant's counsel on 1 September 2003.",1,623
195,195,"5. The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Pavlograd. 6. In June 2003 the applicant instituted proceedings for damages against Oranta State Insurance Company in the Babushkinskyy District Court of Dnipropetrovsk (“the Babushkinskyy Court”). 7. On 18 April 2005 the court dismissed the claim as unsubstantiated. 8. On 1 September 2005 and 18 May 2006 the judgment was upheld by the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Ukraine, respectively. 9. In June 2003 the applicant also instituted proceedings against her former employer, the local police department, seeking recovery of some retirement-related and other payments. 10. On 10 May 2005 the Babushkinskyy Court found against her. 11. On 17 November 2005 the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Court of Appeal upheld the judgment. It stated in the operative part that the applicant had the right to challenge the decision before the Higher Administrative Court within one month. 12. The applicant appealed in cassation. 13. On 3 February 2006 the Higher Administrative Court declined jurisdiction to consider her appeal in cassation on the ground that the case was of a “civil” rather than an “administrative” nature and therefore the Supreme Court was the correct court of cassation. 14. The applicant resubmitted her appeal in cassation to the Supreme Court. On 5 June 2006 the latter, referring to Article 210 of the Code of Administrative Justice, declined jurisdiction asserting that, in fact, the Higher Administrative Court was the appropriate forum for the case. 15. The relevant domestic law and documents of the Council of Europe are quoted in the judgment in Bulanov and Kupchik v. Ukraine (nos. 7714/06 and 23654/08, §§ 20-25, 9 December 2010).",1,275

The Nagatinskiy District Court of Moscow (“the District Court”) scheduled the first hearing for 21 February 2002. Between 21 February 2002 and 17 June 2003 one hearing was held as planned. Six scheduled hearings did not take place due to the respondent’s default in appearance or requests for adjournment, three hearings had to be postponed following the applicants’ failure to appear or requests for adjournment, and three hearings could not proceed as both parties either failed to submit evidence or to show in court altogether. 7. On 17 June 2003 the District Court considered that the applicants no longer intended to pursue their civil action and decided to strike the case out of its list. 8. On 7 August 2003 the applicants asked the court to reinstate the case to its list claiming that they had not been able to appear at the hearings because the first applicant had been undergoing hospital treatment. 9. On 9 September 2003 the District Court quashed its earlier decision and reinstated the case to its list. The next hearing was scheduled for 3 November 2003. Between 3 November 2003 and 12 July 2004 five hearings were held as planned, whereas five other hearings were postponed due to the fault of the respondent, two for the applicants’ failure to appear, and two others for both parties’ default. 10. On 12 July 2004 the District Court again considered that the applicants no longer intended to pursue their civil action and decided to strike the case out of its list. 11. On 22 December 2004 the applicants asked the court to reinstate the case to its list. On 19 January 2005 the District Court quashed its decision of 12 July 2004 after finding that the applicants had not been duly notified of certain unspecified hearings and resumed the proceedings. The next hearing was scheduled for 31 January 2005. 12. The hearing of 31 January 2005 was adjourned as the respondent did not appear. 13. On 16 February and 10 March 2005 the hearings were held as planned. 14. On 11 March 2005 the District Court dismissed the applicants’ claims in full. 15. On 8 June 2005 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment on appeal. 16. On an unspecified date the first applicant sued the Military Commission of Moscow for recalculation of his pension. 17. On 14 July 2006 the Justice of the Peace of the 384th Court Circuit of the Meshchanskiy District of Moscow dismissed his claims. 18.

A committee of experts assessed the value of the plots of land and the relevant amount was paid to the applicants when the expropriation took place. 6. Following the applicants’ request for increased compensation, on 22 June 1998 the Bornova Civil Court of First-instance awarded them additional compensation plus interest at the statutory rate. 7. On 8 December 1998 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment. 8. On 27 July 1999 the Bornova Civil Court of First-instance awarded the applicants additional compensation plus interest at the statutory rate. 9. On 12 October 1999 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment. 10. On 15 May 2000 the Bornova Civil Court of First-instance awarded the applicants additional compensation of 9,976,332,312 Turkish liras (TRL) plus interest at the statutory rate applicable at the date of the court’s decision, running from 26 February 1998, the date on which the title deed to the land had been transferred to the General Directorate of National Roads and Highways in the land registry. 11. On 11 September 2000 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment. 12. On 13 August 2001 the General Directorate of National Roads and Highways paid the applicants TRL 28,686,390,000. 13.

204,204,"4. On various dates each of the applicants received one or more final decisions awarding payments from companies (see appendix for details) in which the State holds at least 25% of the share capital, and instituted enforcement proceedings to collect the payments. 5. Some of the applicants disagreed with the amounts awarded to them in the above decisions. Mr Ostroverkhov, for instance, appealed against the decision of 26 June 2000 in his favour but it appears that he failed to comply with the procedural requirements and his appeals were rejected. He did not appeal against the decision of 24 May 2002. 6. After the decisions in the applicants' favour had become final, insolvency or liquidation proceedings against the debtors were initiated. On that account, the State Bailiffs' Service terminated the enforcement proceedings against them and transferred the applicants' writs of enforcement to the relevant bankruptcy trustees or liquidation commissions for further processing. At the end, some of the debtors were liquidated. 7. The decisions in the applicants' favour remain unenforced. 8. The relevant domestic law is set out in the judgment of 26 April 2005 in the case of Sokur v. Ukraine (no. 29439/02, §§ 17-22).",1,196

Spiz, a lawyer practising in Zagreb. The respondent Government were represented by successive Agents: Ms L. Lukina-Karajković and Ms Š. Stažnik. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 18 August 1995 a member of the Croatian Army allegedly damaged the applicant’s car. On 3 October 1995 the applicant instituted civil proceedings before the Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu) seeking damages from the State. The court held hearings on 15 April 1996, 2 April 1998 and on 8 December 1998. On 6 November 1999 the Civil Obligations (Amendments) Act 1999 (Zakon o dopunama Zakona o obveznim odnosima) entered into force. It provided that proceedings for damage caused by members of the army and the police from 17 August 1990 to 30 June 1996 would be stayed. The court held hearings thereafter: on 18 March 2002, 11 March 2003, 2 March 2004 and on 10 December 2004. It would appear that the proceedings in issue are still pending. The Civil Obligations (Amendments) Act 1999 (Zakon o dopunama Zakona o obveznim odnosima, Official Gazette no. 112/1999, hereinafter “the 1999 Act”) entered into force on 6 November 1999. It provided, inter alia, that proceedings instituted against the State for damage caused by members of the army and the police during the war were to be stayed until the matter has been regulated by special legislation. The Act also imposed an obligation on the Government to submit to the Parliament such special legislation no later than 6 May 2000. The relevant part of the Civil Procedure Act (Zakon o parničnom postupku, Official Gazette nos. 53/1991, 91/1992, 112/1999 and 117/2003) provides: “Proceedings shall be stayed: ... (6) where another statute so prescribes.” The “Damage Caused by Members of the Croatian Army and Police during the Homeland War Act 2003” (Zakon o odgovornosti Republike Hrvatske za štetu uzrokovanu od pripadnika Hrvatskih oružanih i redarstvenih snaga tijekom Domovinskog rata, Official Gazette no. 117/2003, hereinafter “the 2003 Act”) entered into force on 31 July 2003. It provides that proceedings which were stayed pursuant to the 1999 Act will resume and defines circumstances in which the State is liable for damage caused by members of the army and the police during the war. The relevant part of section 63 of the Constitutional Court Act 1999 (Ustavni zakon o Ustavnom sudu Republike Hrvatske, its consolidated text was published in the Official Gazette no. 49/2002), as amended on 15 March 2002, reads as follows: “(1) The Constitutional Court shall examine a constitutional complaint whether or not all legal remedies have been exhausted if the court with jurisdiction fails to decide a claim concerning the applicant’s rights and obligations or a criminal charge against him or her within a reasonable time ...

Nikolova, of the Ministry of Justice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 15 November 1997 the applicant entered into a preliminary contract under which a Mr K.N. undertook to sell to the applicant a plot of land. Shortly afterwards, K.N. died. On 17 November 1998 the applicant brought an action against K.N.’s heirs before the Sofia District Court, requesting the court to declare the contract final. In these proceedings the applicant argued that K.N. could have sold the land as he had obtained it through adverse possession. The defendants contested the claim, stating that the land had belonged to their father, a son of K.N., who had died before K.N. and who had purchased the plot in 1969. The court held a number of hearings in which the applicant participated without counsel. By a judgment of 19 May 2000 the District Court dismissed the action, finding that the preliminary contract had been null and void ab initio as it had not determined with sufficient precision the boundaries of the disputed plot of land. On an unspecified date the applicant filed an appeal with the Sofia Regional Court. The court held several hearings. At the hearing of 7 February 2002 the applicant failed to appear. According to the record from the hearing, the court accepted a request, filed by the applicant’s representative, for additional evidence to be obtained. By a judgment of 9 July 2002 the Regional Court upheld the lower court’s judgment. On 5 December 2002 the applicant filed a cassation appeal, presenting once again his arguments, namely that the preliminary contract had been valid as the plot had been identifiable and that K.N. had acquired it through adverse possession. The defendants made submissions in reply, which were accessible to the applicant. The hearing before the Supreme Court of Cassation was listed for 18 February 2004. On 16 February 2004 the applicant requested the adjournment of the hearing on the ground of ongoing health problems. In support he presented a medical certificate. At the hearing on 18 February 2004 the defendants objected to the applicant’s request for adjournment. They stated that the applicant had counsel who could represent him. Following deliberations, the court found that the applicant: “... had had counsel in the proceedings before the second-instance court as evident from the legal representation contract [between him and] P.V. [The latter] was authorised to represent the [applicant] at all levels of the court proceedings ...” The court therefore found that the conditions for adjournment set out in Article 107 § 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure had not been met and proceeded with the hearing. At the hearing the defendants requested that the cassation appeal be dismissed on the grounds already set out in their written submissions in reply to the cassation appeal. By a judgment of 27 February 2004 the Supreme Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal. The court examined the arguments of the parties and agreed with the applicant that the preliminary contract had been valid. It found, however, that K.N. had never obtained title to the plot. The applicant has submitted a declaration by P.V. to the effect that he never acted as counsel for the applicant in the proceedings at issue. At the material time the relevant court was under a duty to adjourn a hearing in the event that a party and his representative were not able to attend due to an impediment which the party could not have removed (Article 107 § 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1952). This provision was reproduced verbatim in the new Code of Civil Procedure 2007 (Article 142 § 2). At the material time the cassation appeal was to be submitted to the relevant Court of Appeal which was under a duty to send a copy to the other party. The other party was then entitled to submit, within fourteen days, submissions in reply to the cassation appeal. On expiration of this period, the Court of Appeal was duty-bound to send both the cassation appeal and the reply to the Supreme Court of Cassation, which would then examine the case in an open hearing (Article 218в § 1 in relation to Articles 218г and 218e of the Code of Civil Procedure 1952). The Code of Civil Procedure 2007 introduced new requirements and procedure for the admissibility of cassation appeals.",0,764
211,211,"The applicants, Mr Žarko Simić (“the first applicant”), Mr Vid Malešević (“the second applicant”) and Ms Smiljka Malešević (“the third applicant”) are all Serbian citizens who were born in 1958, 1935 and 1938, respectively. The first applicant lives in Kragujevac and was represented before the Court by Mr M. Ribarić, a lawyer practising in the same town. The other two applicants live in Paris and were represented before the Court by Mr W. Bourdon, a lawyer practising in the same town. The Government of Serbia (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. Following the financial collapse of numerous banks in Serbia, in 1998 and 2002 the respondent State adopted specific legislation accepting to convert the foreign currency deposits in these banks, including the banks here at issue, into a public debt and then went on to set the time-frame (2016) and the amounts, including interest, to be paid back to their former clients. This legislation, inter alia, also explicitly provided that Serbian citizens living abroad, i.e. those living outside of the territory of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, were also entitled to benefit from it. On 1 March 1987 the applicant’s father deposited an unspecified amount of German Marks for a fixed period of time with the Jugobanka - Kragujevac, the interest rate having been stipulated at 7.25% annually. It would appear that by 1 April 1992 the applicant’s father had a total of 41,900 German Marks on the account in question. After the expiration of the fixed-period deposit contract, in 1993 the bank appears to have refused to release his funds or even to apply the interest rate initially stipulated. On an unspecified date thereafter, the applicant’s father died and the applicant became his sole successor. Just like his father, however, the applicant was unable to withdraw or otherwise freely use his foreign currency savings. On 16 June 2003 the applicant had 26,887.49 Euros converted into Government bonds, having in the meantime been paid back a total of 3,978 Euros in accordance with the said legislation. There is no information that the applicant had received any payments thereafter. By the late 1990s the second applicant had a total of 143,000 Swiss Francs, 53,000 German Marks, and 39,000 French Francs deposited for a fixed period of time with the Privredna Bank Beograd AD, the interest rate having initially been stipulated at 11% annually. By the same time, the third applicant had deposited a total of 42,000 French Francs for a fixed period of time with the Privredna Bank Beograd AD, the interest rate having initially been stipulated at 12.5% annually. On an unspecified date thereafter the bank in question refused to release the applicants’ funds or even to apply the interest rate stipulated. It would appear that, following the adoption of the relevant legislation, the first applicant converted his foreign currency savings deposited in two other banks into public debt in August 2003. However, none of the applicants requested the conversion of the foreign currency savings deposited with the Privredna Bank Beograd AD. The relevant domestic law is set out in the Court’s decision of Šekerović v. Serbia (dec.), no. 32472/03, 4 January 2006, at sections B.1 and B.2.",0,549
213,213,"5. The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Tököl. 6. In 1999 the applicant was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for armed robbery by the Rimini Court in Italy. (The European Court of Human Rights subsequently held that the unfairness of the underlying proceedings gave rise to a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention by the Italian authorities and awarded the applicant just satisfaction: Somogyi v. Italy, no. 67972/01, ECHR 2004IV). The end date of this sentence was 28 December 2007. 7. On 19 May 2003 the applicant was transferred to Hungary. On 20 October 2003 the Budapest Regional Court in Hungary held that he was to serve the remainder of his sentence under a strict regime in a Hungarian prison (fegyház) and that he could be released on parole after serving four-fifths of the term, i.e. on 23 May 2006. 8. The applicant appealed. On 16 February 2006 the Attorney General's Office intervened in the case, filing a motion for remedy in support of the applicant. The Office argued that the service of the applicant's sentence under a strict regime constituted an undue aggravation of his penal situation, in breach of Article 11 of the Transfer Convention, which entailed that he could be released on probation only belatedly. 9. On 14 March 2006 the Supreme Court quashed the Regional Court's decisions concerning the regime of the applicant's transferred sentence and his conditional release, holding that they were unlawful. It held that the best approximation of the Italian sentence in Hungarian law was to have imposed a medium regime (börtön) on the applicant for the remainder of his prison term, release on parole then being possible after having served three-quarters of the sentence. 10. On 17 March 2006 the applicant was released. 11. Subsequently, the applicant brought an official liability action against the Regional Court. He claimed compensation for the fact that, because of that court's wrong reconciliation of the Italian and Hungarian penitentiary rules, he had been released on parole only on 17 March 2006, whereas under the medium regime he could have already been released in November 2005. He also sought damages for having erroneously spent two years and five months in a strict-regime prison. 12. After divergent decisions, on 15 May 2008 the Supreme Court finally dismissed the action. Concerning the belated release, it held that, although the Regional Court's interpretation of the law had been overruled, there was no indication that it had carried out the complex task of reconciling the inconsistent Italian and Hungarian rules with gross negligence giving rise to tort liability. As to the period wrongly spent in a strict-regime prison, it noted that the applicant had not substantiated that he had sustained any actual damage. 13. From 1994 onwards, criminal proceedings were conducted against the applicant in Hungary for the abuse of firearms. On 6 February 2004 the Buda Central District Court sentenced him to four months' suspended imprisonment. The court observed that unlicensed firearms had been found in the applicant's car and, in so doing, it relied on the testimony of several witnesses. It took into account the extreme protraction of the case since 1994 as a crucial mitigating circumstance entailing a suspended sentence. 14. On 12 May 2005 the Budapest Regional Court upheld this judgment. On 15 November 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant's petition for review. 15. The Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons (European Treaty Series no. 112) provides as follows: “The enforcement of the sentence shall be governed by the law of the administering State and that State alone shall be competent to take all appropriate decisions. ...” “1. In the case of continued enforcement, the administering State shall be bound by the legal nature and duration of the sentence as determined by the sentencing State. 2. If, however, this sentence is by its nature or duration incompatible with the law of the administering State, or its law so requires, that State may, by a court or administrative order, adapt the sanction to the punishment or measure prescribed by its own law for a similar offence. As to its nature, the punishment or measure shall, as far as possible, correspond with that imposed by the sentence to be enforced. It shall not aggravate, by its nature or duration, the sanction imposed in the sentencing State, nor exceed the maximum prescribed by the law of the administering State.” “In the case of conversion of sentence, the procedures provided for by the law of the administering State apply. When converting the sentence, the competent authority: ... d. shall not aggravate the penal position of the sentenced person, and shall not be bound by any minimum which the law of the administering State may provide for the offence or offences committed.”",1,798
214,214,"5. The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in the town of Ryazan in the Ryazan Region. He is a former military officer. 6. In 2002 the applicant sued his military unit for wage arrears for his military service in 1996 when he had taken part in a military operation in Tajikistan. 7. On 22 February 2002 the Military Court of the Ryazan Garrison upheld the action and awarded the applicant 163,732.80 Russian roubles (RUR). The judgment was not appealed against and became final. 8. On 3 April 2002 the applicant received a writ of execution and submitted it to the Ryazan Office of the State Treasury. On 26 April 2002, after the Ryazan Office of the State Treasury had refused to execute the judgement, the applicant submitted the writ to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation. 9. On 30 September 2002 the applicant was discharged from the army. 10. On 16 July 2003 the Presidium of the Military Court of the Moscow Command, by way of a supervisory review, quashed the judgment of 22 February 2002 and remitted the case for a fresh examination to the Military Court of the Ryazan Garrison. 11. On 15 September 2003 the Military Court of the Ryazan Garrison decided not to examine the action as the applicant had defaulted at two hearings. 12. On 12 August 2004 the Military Section of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, acting on a supervisory review, found that the applicant had not been duly summonsed to the hearings before the Military Court of the Ryazan Garrison, quashed the judgment of 16 July 2003 and the decision of 15 September 2003 and ordered a re-examination of the case by the Presidium of the Military Court of the Moscow Command. 13. On 15 September 2004 the Presidium of the Military Court of the Moscow Command, by way of supervisory-review proceedings, re-examined the case, awarded the applicant RUR 56,311.20 and dismissed the remainder of his claims. 14. In January 2005 the applicant asked the Military Section of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation to initiate a supervisory review in respect of the judgment of 15 September 2004. On 3 May 2005 the request was dismissed. 15. In July 2005 the applicant unsuccessfully requested the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation to quash the judgment of 15 September 2004 by way of a supervisory review. On 10 August 2005 the Vice President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation refused to institute supervisory-review proceedings in respect of the judgment of 15 September 2004.",1,431
217,217,"1. The applicants state that they are nationals of the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus”. Their names, dates of birth and places of residence are set out in the Annex. They are represented before the Court by Ms Y. Renda, a lawyer practising in Nicosia. 2. The facts of the cases may be summarised as follows. They are relatives of Turkish-Cypriot men who went missing in either December 1963 or April-May 1964 during incidents of mounting tension and violence in which Turkish Cypriots or Turkish-Cypriot villages were targeted (see Annex for further details). 3. These men were listed as missing persons, the information being given to the Cypriot authorities, the Red Cross and the United Nations. 4. The remains of the missing men have been found during exhumations carried out by the United Nations Committee for Missing Persons(“CMP”) in 20069. Further details are set out in the Annex. 5. In three cases, the applicants wrote to the Cypriot authorities requesting information about any investigation into the disappearance of their relative and/or the discovery of the remains: in Akay and Others, no. 32744/08, by letter dated 6 May 2009 to the Minister of the Interior, in Gürtekin and Others, no. 3706/09, by letter dated 14 November 2008 to the Minister of the Interior and in Arkut and Others, no. 25180/09, by letters dated 22 February 2009, to the Attorney-General and to the Minister of the Interior. No reply or information was received, save for an e-mail from the Attorney-General’s office dated 18 March 2009 in the Arkut case, stating that all necessary action would be taken. 6. In this case, the claimants challenged the decision in 1997 to remove their relative, a Greek-Cypriot combatant last seen in July 1974, from the list of missing persons after examination of the list by the Attorney-General of the Republic of Cyprus; his file was communicated to the TurkishCypriot side instead on the basis that he had died of wounds during the fighting and not to the Committee of Missing Persons. In a decision dated 16 October 2003, the Supreme Court in its appellate jurisdiction rejected the case on the basis that the case did not concern an administrative decision but was an act of government outside the court’s jurisdiction. Matters relating to missing persons were part of the Cyprus problem and fell within the power of the political authority. 7. In these cases lodged in 2006, the relatives of five Turkish Cypriot men who went missing on 14 August 1974 after they had been taken from their homes by armed Greek Cypriots, lodged applications under Article 146 of the Constitution, claiming that the Republic of Cyprus had known of the deaths of the missing persons but had not searched for the corpses or brought the guilty persons to justice and that the Republic had not taken the necessary actions to pursue an effective investigation to determine the whereabouts and fate of the missing persons. In their response, the Republic of Cyprus stated that they had not been passive but had been unable to pursue their intentions to exhume and identify corpses due to the agreement between the United Nations, the Turkish-Cypriot side and themselves that exhumations would be conducted by a common programme of the Committee of Missing Persons. They also pointed out that exhumations had begun in 2004 and the programme indicated the likelihood of the exhumation of the graves in the relevant area would commence in August 2008. They disputed that the matter fell within the jurisdiction of the courts but fell rather under the supervision of the United Nations and the authority and initiative of the President of the Republic. 8. In its decision dated 29 May 2008, the Supreme Court in its appellate capacity held that the fate of missing persons fell under the authority of the President of the Republic as it had an international aspect; the cases therefore concerned an act of government which did not fall within the jurisdiction to annul of the Supreme Court.",0,668
218,218,"5. The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Śrem. 6. In 1995 the applicant’s husband died on a pedestrian crossing after being hit by a car. The car was being driven by a certain B.M. 7. On 20 July 1998 the applicant filed a claim against B.M. and the “Warta” Insurance Company with the Poznań Regional Court, seeking compensation in the amount of 50,000 Polish zlotys (PLN). At the same time the applicant requested the court to give her a full exemption from the costs of the proceedings. She submitted that she received only a small pension and that her health had significantly deteriorated. 8. On 21 June 1998 the Regional Court partly granted the applicant’s request. It exempted her from the court fee for processing her claim (wpis od pozwu). 9. On 25 November 1999 the Śrem District Court in the course of criminal proceedings convicted B.M. of having caused a traffic accident which resulted in a fatality and sentenced him, inter alia, to a suspended prison term. 10. In January 2001 the applicant filed her amended claim with the Regional Court. She sought an award of PLN 130,000 in compensation and PLN 500 as a supplementary monthly allowance. 11. On 28 December 2001 the Poznań Regional Court awarded the applicant PLN 20,000 to be paid jointly and severally by the defendants and dismissed her further claims. The applicant was ordered to pay the costs of the defendants in the amount of PLN 3,726.10. 12. On 18 January 2002 the applicant lodged an appeal against the firstinstance judgment. On the same day the Regional Court ordered the applicant to pay PLN 7,100 in court fees for proceeding with her appeal. 13. On 29 January 2002 the applicant asked the Regional Court for an exemption from the relevant fees. She submitted that her income consisted only of a monthly pension in the amount of PLN 800 and that she did not have any property or valuable movables. She also claimed that her health had significantly deteriorated since her husband’s death. 14. On 5 February 2002 the Poznań Regional Court dismissed her request. It considered, in so far as relevant: “(...) It should be underlined that the obligation to demonstrate the preconditions for an exemption from the costs rests with the claimant. Examining the claimant’s request, the court considers that it cannot be granted. The claimant did not demonstrate that she was unable to bear the [relevant] costs without entailing a substantial reduction in her and her family’s standard of living. A person requesting exemption from costs should submit a declaration of means that she is unable to pay the costs, including detailed information about her family status, her assets and her income, which have to be supported by relevant documents. In a case where a person seeking exemption from costs has a representative who is an advocate, that representative has an obligation to inform his client about the requirements attached to a declaration of means and the necessary information which must be included therein. In that case, the court is not required to summon the representative of a party seeking exemption from costs to submit an additional declaration. For these reasons, considering that the claimant’s request did not contain the required declaration of means, which implies that there is no information enabling [the court] to examine the merits of the request, the court, pursuant to Article 113 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, held as in the operative part of the decision.” 15. The applicant appealed. She relied on the same arguments as before the Regional Court. 16. On 23 April 2002 the Poznań Court of Appeal dismissed her interlocutory appeal. It found, in so far as relevant: “... The Court of Appeal considers that the grounds of appeal do not justify a departure from the findings of the first-instance court in respect of the appellant’s ability to pay the [relevant] costs. The Court of Appeal draws attention to the fact that the claimant received the whole amount of compensation awarded [by the first-instance court]. Thus, there were no grounds to hold that she was unable to bear the costs without a reduction in her own necessary support. ...” 17. As a result, the applicant was prevented from lodging an appeal against the judgment of the Poznań Regional Court of 28 December 2001. 18. The legal provisions applicable at the material time and questions of practice are set out in paragraphs 23-33 of the judgment delivered by the Court on 19 June 2001 in the case of Kreuz v. Poland (no. 28249/95, ECHR 2001-VI; see also Jedamski and Jedamska v. Poland, no. 73547/01), §§ 29-39).",1,779
219,219,"The applicant, Mr Resul Taşdemir, is a Turkish national who was born in 1979. He was serving a sentence in the Erzurum Prison when the application was lodged. On 6 September 2005, to celebrate World Peace day, the applicant participated in a demonstration in the district of Doğubeyazıt in the Ağrı Province, outside the building that housed the DEHAP (the Democratic People's Party). During the demonstration someone read out a press statement and the crowd, including the applicant, shouted slogans. Subsequently, criminal proceedings were initiated against the applicant and five other accused persons, pursuant to Article 215 of the Criminal Code, for praising a criminal and a crime. In the indictment, the prosecution stated that the applicant had shouted “Biji Serok Apo, HPG cepheye misillemeye” (Long live Apo! HPG (the armed wing of the PKK) to the front line in retaliation!). During the proceedings, the court took into consideration the defence statements of the accused, as well as CD recordings and photographs taken during the demonstration. Before the court, the applicant accepted that he was the person in the CD recording and the photograph. He further stated he had shouted slogans in support of peace. In a final decision dated 13 April 2007, the Erzurum Assize Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to twenty-five days' imprisonment. The court then commuted the prison sentence to a fine of 500 Turkish liras (TRY) (equivalent to 270 euros). As the applicant failed to pay the fine, he served his sentence of imprisonment.",0,252

Milinchuk, former Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights, and Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 14 November 2001 the Frunzenskiy District Court of Vladivostok upheld the applicant’s action against the Military Commissariat of the Primorye Region (the Commissariat) and awarded him 6,137 Russian roubles (RUB) in compensation for damage and court expenses. The District Court also held that the Commissariat should sign a contract with a commercial provider of communication services undertaking the obligation to pay 50% of monthly costs for phone services provided to the applicant. The judgment was upheld on appeal and became final on 17 December 2001. In August 2002 the applicant complained to the Frunzenskiy District Court about the Commissariat’s failure to enforce the judgment. On 26 August 2002 the Frunzenskiy District Court found that the Commissariat’s inactivity was unlawful. The judgment was not appealed against. On 16 September 2002 enforcement proceedings were closed as the Commissariat had paid RUB 6,137 to the applicant. However, a week later the proceedings were re-opened because the payment only constituted a partial enforcement of the judgment and because the Commissariat had not yet signed a contract with the communication services provider. According to the Government, on 18 September 2002 the Commissariat paid to the applicant RUB 611 as a 50 % compensation of monthly costs for phone services provided to the applicant. On 1 November 2002 the Commissariat signed the contract with the communication services provider and thus fully enforced the judgment of 14 November 2001 as upheld on 17 December 2001.",0,311
221,221,"The applicant, Mrs Cihan Sincar, is a Turkish national, who was born in 1957 and lives in Mardin. She is represented before the Court by Mrs Bedia Buran, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. The applicant’s husband, Mehmet Sincar, was a member of parliament (MP) for the Democracy Party (hereinafter referred to as the DEP) at the time of the event. On 2 September 1993 unknown persons shot the brothers of the DEP’s vice president, both MPs for the same party, in Batman. One of them died and the other was injured. On 4 September 1993 the applicant’s husband, Mehmet Sincar, and a member of the DEP’s Executive Committee in Batman, who had been sent to the region to investigate these murders, were also shot dead. The Batman Public Prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against twelve suspects under Article 146 of the Turkish Criminal Code. He subsequently declined jurisdiction in the matter and transferred the investigation file to the prosecutor of the Diyarbakır State Security Court, who brought criminal proceedings against the suspects under Article 146 of the Turkish Criminal Code, charging them with an “attempt to undermine the constitutional order of the State” in relation to the death of the applicant’s husband. The Diyarbakır State Security Court acquitted ten of the suspects on 29 November 1994 and the remaining two on 26 November 1996. On 2 October 1998, Mrs Sincar applied for and obtained a copy of the court’s decision to acquit the alleged perpetrators. On an unspecified date, the former Minister of the Interior Mehmet Ağar claimed this murder to have been carried out by a terrorist organisation, namely the Hizbullah. At the beginning of 1998, the so-called Susurluk report was produced at the request of the Prime Minister, by Mr Kutlu Savaş, the Vice-President of the Board of Inspectors of the Prime Minister’s Office. It was stated on page 31 of this report that “the murder of Mehmet Sincar had been plotted and carried out in accomplice by A.K., M.M., İ. Y., and A. D. and that following this event A.K. had signed a letter in relation to the murder”. This report was not deemed sufficient evidence by the public prosecutors to initiate criminal proceedings against the identified perpetrators. In Turkish law – for the purposes of preliminary investigations by prosecutors – criminal acts are divided into two categories; firstly those in respect of which a victim must inform the prosecutor so that an investigation can be started by the latter, and secondly, those in respect of which the victim is not required to make a complaint in order for an investigation to be started by the prosecutor (Article 151 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, hereinafter the CCP). Threat is classified as one of the crimes in the first category. Murder is classified as one of the crimes in the second category; however, this does not prevent relatives of victims from lodging criminal complaints with the authorities. A public prosecutor who is informed by any means whatsoever of a situation that gives rise to the suspicion that an offence has been committed is obliged to investigate the facts by conducting the necessary inquiries to identify the perpetrators (Article 153 CCP). The public prosecutor may institute criminal proceedings if he or she decides that the evidence justifies the indictment of a suspect (Article 163 CCP). If it appears that the evidence against a suspect is insufficient to justify the institution of criminal proceedings, the public prosecutor may close the investigation in respect of that person. However, the public prosecutor may decide not to prosecute if the evidence is clearly insufficient. 3. Right to intervene in the public prosecution. Pursuant to Article 365 of the CCP, any person who is injured by the offence may, at any phase of the investigation, intervene in the public prosecution. Those so intervening in public prosecution proceedings may also submit their personal claims for adjudication.",0,666
223,223,"4. The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Budapest. 5. On 28 December 1987 the applicant brought an action against his ex-wife, seeking the division of their matrimonial property. 6. In the period between 29 March 1988 and 19 May 1992, ten hearings took place and the opinions of valuation experts were obtained. 7. Further hearings took place on 19 September, 28 October and 16 December 1994, 2 February and 23 March 1995. Meanwhile, the expert was invited to submit a new opinion and to complete it subsequently. 8. On 20 June 1995 the Buda Central District Court ordered the applicant to pay 675,000 Hungarian forints (HUF) to his ex-wife. 9. On appeal, the Budapest Regional Court, on 8 March 1996, quashed parts of the appealed judgment and remitted those parts to the District Court. Furthermore, it fixed the parties’ respective shares of the property. 10. On 27 May 1997, on the applicant’s petition for review, the Supreme Court quashed the second-instance judgment concerning the establishment of the parties’ property shares. Accordingly, this part of the case was also remitted to the District Court. 11. In the resumed proceedings, the District Court held hearings on 19 June, 1 September and 27 October 1998; it also appointed another expert. On 21 January 1999 the applicant’s motion for bias was dismissed. 12. Further hearings took place on 19 October 1999, 24 January and 6 March 2000. An on-site inspection scheduled for 19 September 2000 had to be postponed, because the applicant did not agree to the defendant’s personal attendance. A new opinion was submitted by the expert on 28 February 2001. 13. Another hearing was held on 19 June 2001. The next one scheduled for 10 July 2001 was postponed at the applicant’s request to 23 August 2001. 14. On 5 September 2001 the District Court fixed the parties’ respective shares in a real-estate of common ownership, granted ownership of it to the applicant and ordered him to pay compensation and unrealised rent to his ex-wife. The court relied on documentary evidence, the testimonies of the parties and the opinions of two expert architects. On 12 November 2001 the applicant appealed. 15. An appeal hearing took place on 1 March 2002. On 22 March 2002 the appellate court appointed an expert, who submitted his opinion on 25 June 2002. 16. On 6 November 2002 the Regional Court increased the amount of compensation to be paid by the applicant. It further quashed the part of the District Court judgment which concerned the unrealised rent and discontinued the proceedings in this regard. The judgment acquired legal force. 17. On 19 December 2002 the applicant filed a petition for review, alleging that the final decision was unfounded and at variance with the relevant substantive law. 18. In a preliminary examination under section 273 of the Code of Civil Procedure, on 13 May 2003 the Supreme Court refused to deal with the merits of the petition. It applied section 270 § 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as in force in the relevant period, according to which a review of substantive unlawfulness of final decisions was only admissible if a review was considered necessary from the perspective of harmonising or developing the application of the law. 19. On 24 September 2003 the Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s request to have the final decision rectified. It held that, in essence, the request was aimed at challenging certain provisions of the final decision which constituted res iudicata and was thus incompatible ratione materiae with the procedural rules concerning the rectification of decisions.",1,597

On 4 July 1997 the Kyivsky District Court of Donetsk (hereinafter “the District Court”) fined the applicant UAH 225 under an administrative procedure for a corruption offence. The applicant was consequently dismissed from his position. 6. On 17 November 1997 the Donetsk Regional Court quashed this judgment and terminated the proceedings. 7. On 22 May 2000 the District Court awarded the applicant UAH 500 in compensation for moral damage to be paid by the State Treasury of Ukraine. 8. This judgment was not appealed and became final on 2 June 2000. 9. In June 2000 the Kyivsky Office of the Bailiffs’ Service in Donetsk initiated the enforcement proceedings. 10. On 22 October 2004 the writ of execution was transferred to the Pechersky Office of the Bailiffs’ Service in Kyiv, which on 7 December 2004 refused to open the enforcement proceedings and transferred the writ to the Department of the Bailiffs’ Service of the Ministry of Justice (hereinafter “the Department”). 11. On 24 January 2005 the Department refused to open the enforcement proceedings on the ground that it fell outside of its competence. 12. Since May 2005 the enforcement proceedings are pending before the Donetsk Department of the Bailiffs’ Service. 13. The judgment of 22 May 2000 remains unenforced. 14. The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Voytenko v. Ukraine (no. 18966/02, §§ 20-25, 29 June 2004).",1,250
234,234,"The applicant, Mr Lucjan Roman Liss, is a Polish national (formerly a German national) who was born in 1950 and lives in Bergkamen. He was represented before the Court by Mr Joachim J. Lassonczyk, a lawyer practising in Hamm. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich the applicant won a silver medal in cycling, representing Poland. In 1977 the applicant developed kidney trouble and went to West Germany to undergo dialysis and a kidney transplant. According to the applicant’s submissions, such treatment was not available in Poland at that time. In 1980 he had his first transplant. Also in 1980 the applicant’s mother died and the applicant was granted a single-entry visa to Poland on an exceptional basis. In 1986 the applicant waived his Polish citizenship and became a German national. B. Events after 10 October 1994 In 1995 the applicant underwent another kidney transplant in Germany. On 4 February 2000 the applicant requested the Polish President of the Office for Physical Education and Sport (Prezes Urzędu Kultury Fizycznej i Sportu) to grant him a special payment provided for Olympians. On 16 March 2000 the President of the Office for Physical Education and Sport refused his request on the ground that he was not a Polish national and did not have his permanent place of residence in Poland as required by the relevant law. On 8 April 2000 the applicant lodged a request for reconsideration of that decision. On 12 May 2000 the President of the Office for Physical Education and Sport confirmed his decision of 16 March 2000. The applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (Naczelny Sąd Administracyjny). On 6 December 2000 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. The court found that the applicant had not satisfied two of the five conditions listed in section 28a of the Act of 18 January 1996 on Physical Education (ustawa o kulturze fizycznej) (“the 1996 Act”), namely he was not a Polish national and did not have his place of residence in Poland. Accordingly, the court found that the challenged decision had been given in accordance with the law and that the applicant’s complaint therefore had to be dismissed. In 2003 the applicant requested the relevant Polish authorities to grant him Polish citizenship. On 11 February 2004 the President of the Republic of Poland granted the applicant Polish citizenship. On 1 September 2005 the Professional Sports Act (Ustawa o sporcie kwalifikowanym) of 29 July 2005 entered into force. The new law replaced the condition of a permanent place of residence in Poland by a requirement of having a permanent place of residence on the territory of Poland or another member State of the European Union. On 17 January 2006 the Minister of Sport (Minister Sportu) gave a decision and granted the applicant the special payment provided for Olympians in the amount of 2,477.23 Polish zlotys (PLN) monthly, finding that the applicant had fulfilled all the requirements listed in the new law. 1. Special payment for Olympians At the relevant time the issue of special payment for Olympians was regulated by the Law on Physical Education of 18 January 1996 (“the 1996 Act”) (”Ustawa o kulturze fizycznej”). Section 28 a as introduced into “the 1996 Act” by the Law of 4 November 1999 on amendment to the Law on Physical Education (“Ustawa o zmianie ustawy o kulturze fizycznej”) with effect from 1 January 2000, provided, in so far as relevant: “Representatives of Poland in the Summer or Winter Olympic Games, who: 1) have won at least one Olympic medal, 2) are at least thirty-five years of age and do not take part in competitive sports, 3) have Polish citizenship, 4) have their permanent place of residence on the territory of Poland, 5) have not been convicted of an intentional offence - are entitled to payments from the State Treasury.” On 1 September 2005 the 1996 Act was amended and the provisions on special payments for Olympians were incorporated in the new Professional Sports Act of 29 July 2005 (ustawa o sporcie kwalifikowanym). The relevant amendment, which entered into force on 1 September 2005, broadened the range of persons entitled to the special payment by including those who had their permanent place of residence either in Poland or in another EU member State. The criterion of Polish nationality remained. Article 79 § 1 of the Constitution, which entered into force on 17 October 1997, provides as follows: “In accordance with principles specified by statute, everyone whose constitutional freedoms or rights have been infringed, shall have the right to appeal to the Constitutional Court for a judgment on the conformity with the Constitution of a statute or another normative act on the basis of which a court or an administrative authority has issued a final decision on his freedoms or rights or on his obligations specified in the Constitution.” At the relevant time Article 58 of the Act of 11 May 1995 on the Supreme Administrative Court (Ustawa o Naczelnym Sądzie Administracyjnym) provided that in cases terminated by a final judgment of the court the proceedings might be reopened at the request of a party to the proceedings or ex officio... According to Article 59 of that Act provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure applied respectively to the proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Court. Article 4011 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a party to civil proceedings which have ended with a final judgment on the merits can request that these proceedings be re-opened, if the Constitutional Court has found that the legal provision on the basis of which this judgment was given was incompatible with the Constitution.",0,973

On 22 March 1994 the applicant was granted a lease by the Istanbul Municipality to run a car park on a plot of land by the coast in the Kadıköy district of Istanbul. 6. On 14 and 27 July 1999 and 24 March 2000 the National Estate Directorate attached to the Istanbul Revenue Office issued three orders requesting the applicant to pay compensation for occupying the car park between 1 March 1998 and 31 December 1999. 7. On 11 August 1999, 29 September 1999 and 14 April 2000 respectively the applicant filed three separate cases with the Istanbul Administrative Court against the Istanbul Revenue Office, requesting that the orders be annulled. The first case concerned the period between 1 March and 31 December 1998, the second case concerned the period between 1 January and 1 August 1999 and the third case concerned the period between 1 August and 31 December 1999. 8. On 25 May 2000 the Istanbul Administrative Court annulled the orders dated 14 July 1999 and 27 July 1999. The administrative authority appealed. Subsequently on 17 December 2004 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the respective judgments of the Istanbul Administrative Court. 9. On 24 June 2005 the Istanbul Administrative Court followed the reasoning set out in the Supreme Administrative Court's decision and dismissed the cases. The applicant appealed. 10. On 13 March 2006 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the respective judgments of the Istanbul Administrative Court once again. 11. On 13 November 2006 the Istanbul Administrative Court decided to annul the respective compensation orders. 12. According to the information in the case file based on the latest submissions by the parties, both actions are apparently still pending before the Supreme Administrative Court. 13. On 23 February 2001 the Istanbul Administrative Court annulled the compensation order dated 24 March 2000. The administrative authority appealed and subsequently on 4 February 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the judgment of the Istanbul Administrative Court. 14. On 18 April 2006 the Istanbul Administrative Court followed the reasoning set out in the Supreme Administrative Court's decision and dismissed the case. According to the information in the case file, this action is still pending before the Supreme Administrative Court.",1,377
245,245,"The applicant is a trade union whose head office is in Toulouse and whose object is to defend the interests of self-employed nurses. It is represented before the Court by Mr Christian Bettinger of the Paris Bar. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. Since the enactment of the Law of 3 July 1971, relations between members of the medical profession, notably nurses, and the social-security bodies have been governed by collective bargaining agreements made between the trade unions representing the various branches of the profession and the social-security bodies. The agreements do not become effective until they have received relevant ministerial approval. After the Conseil d’État had twice quashed decrees approving the collective bargaining agreement applicable to the nursing profession (in judgments of 17 December 1993 and 29 December 1995) a third agreement was entered into on 5 March 1996 and approved by interministerial decree on 10 April 1996. Immediately after that agreement was signed, the applicant and several other trade unions expressed opposition to it and indicated that they intended to lodge an appeal in the courts once the ministerial decree approving the agreement had been published in the Official Gazette. On 28 May 1996 the French Parliament adopted Law no. 96-452 implementing various health, welfare and regulatory measures. Section 59 of the Law provided: “The ... decree of 10 April 1996 approving the national collective bargaining agreement entered into with the nursing profession on 5 March 1996 is hereby ratified”. On 21 June 1996 the applicant lodged an application for judicial review with the Conseil d’État seeking an order quashing the decree of 10 April 1996 as being ultra vires and an order for the State to pay it 45,000 French francs for the costs incurred. In its written submissions of 9 October 1996 the applicant maintained in particular that section 59 of Law no. 96-452 contravened Article 6 § 1 and Article 13 of the Convention. On 13 June 1997 the Conseil d’État dismissed that application on the ground that: “by virtue of the provisions [of Law no. 96-452], which entered into force before the application was lodged, the lawfulness of the decree which the applicant seeks to have quashed cannot in principle be challenged by way of judicial review as being an ultra vires act”. As to the argument that the statute concerned was incompatible with the provisions of the Convention, the Conseil d’État held that challenging the lawfulness of the impugned regulatory measure did not come within the scope of the Articles relied on.",0,428

He is represented before the Court by Odvetniška Družba Matoz D.O.O., a law firm practising in Koper. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) are represented by their Agent, Mrs N. Pintar Gosenca, State Attorney. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant has been serving his sentence in the closed section of Dob Prison from 4 October 2002. As regards the facilities available to the applicant in the cells and common areas, as well as the health care regime in the prison, the conditions imposed on the applicant regarding activities outside the cells and contact with the outside world in general, see the Court’s decision in the case of Lalić and Others v. Slovenia (dec.), nos. 5711/10, 5719/10, 5754/10, 5803/10, 5956/10, 5958/10, 5987/10, 6091/10, 6647/10 and 6893/10, 27 September 2011. Between 9 October 2002 and 4 October 2004 the applicant was held in cell no 3, Block 4 which measured 59.25 square metres and held fifteen inmates (3.95 square metres of personal space available to each inmate). Subsequently, he was transferred to a single cell in Block 1, which measured 7.14 square metres. On 7 December 2004 he was, due to his health problems, transferred into one of the smaller shared cells in Block 1 that serve as patients rooms, measuring approximately 32 square metres and accommodating four inmates (approximately 8 square metres of personal space available to each inmate). On 28 September 2007 the applicant was transferred into cell no 7, Block 4 which measured 58.94 square metres and held 15 inmates (3.93 square metres of personal space available to each inmate). On 17 June 2010 he was placed in cell no 37, Block 1 that served as patient room and measured approximately 15.83 square metres and accommodated 3 inmates (5.28 square metres of personal space available to each inmate). On 21 June 2010 the applicant was, upon his request, transferred back to a regular room. From October 2002 until August 2010 the applicant was on 258 occasions treated for different health problems in the prison clinic. He has inter alia been undergoing a methadone-maintenance treatment and has been treated by the prison psychiatrist. Between 19 July 2008 and 21 July 2008 the applicant was hospitalised in the Novo mesto General Hospital in connection to a problem with appendicitis. On 29 October 2008 the applicant was diagnosed with hepatitis C. After the infection had been diagnosed, the applicant was referred to an infectologist for the first examination but he initially refused to be examined. He was then examined on 27 March 2009 in the Novo mesto General Hospital by an infectologist who, due to seriousness of the applicant’s condition, referred him to the University Medical Centre in Ljubljana for a second opinion. The applicant refused to undergo the aforementioned examination in the University Medical Centre in Ljubljana. Between 26 March 2010 and 30 March 2010 the applicant was hospitalised in the Novo mesto General Hospital due to the deterioration of his condition. According to the reports drawn up by a prison doctor dated 13 August 2010 and 7 December 2010 the applicant had on several occasions also refused to be examined whereas the applicant’s hepatitis C has been treated according to the medical practice. For the relevant domestic law and practice, see paragraphs 33-35 and 38-47 of the Court’s judgment in the case of Štrucl and Others v.

248,248,"5. The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Bor. 6. On 26 October 2004 the applicant filed a civil claim against his employer, company Z, seeking the payment of outstanding holiday pay (regres za korišćenje godišnjeg odmora) due for 2002 and 2003, the difference between the salary he had received and the minimum salary payable under collective agreements in force at the company for the period from October 2001 to May 2004, statutory interest and legal costs. 7. Following a remittal in 2005, on 15 March 2006 the Bor Municipal Court (Opštinski sud) ruled in favour of the applicant. As regards the outstanding holiday pay, the court observed that company Z had not paid the holiday pay due for 2002 and 2003 to any of its employees, as its alleged parent company had been encountering financial difficulties. The court, however, found these facts to be irrelevant to the outcome of the applicant’s claim, as according to the Labour Act and enterprise bargaining agreements in force at the company he had been entitled to holiday pay regardless of the level of his employer’s profits. 8. On 3 September 2007 the Zaječar District Court (Okružni sud) reversed the part of the Municipal Court’s judgment which concerned holiday pay and legal costs, while upholding the remainder. The District Court based its refusal on the finding, disregarding applicable employment law, that company Z had not paid outstanding holiday pay to any of its employees and therefore that “to accept the applicant’s claim would mean that the applicant would be treated more favourably than his colleagues, who had not received payment of outstanding holiday pay from their employer either”. No further recourse against this judgment was available to the applicant. 9. It would appear that between 2004 and 2009 a number of the applicant’s colleagues lodged the same or similar claims to those of the applicant with the Municipal Court. 10. On 28 April and 2 June 2009 the Municipal Court rejected the claims of the applicant’s colleagues for the same reasons as the District Court had in the applicant’s case. However, the Belgrade Court of Appeal, which, following reforms to the judicial system had become the competent appeal court, overturned both judgments on 29 April and 30 June 2010, respectively. In so doing, the appeal court found that the claimants had been entitled to their outstanding holiday pay by applicable domestic law (see paragraphs 10-13 below), finding that the reasons for judgment given by the Municipal Court in their cases were irrelevant and that it had erred in law in rendering the judgments. 11. Article 90 paragraph 3 stipulated that collective bargaining agreements, labour regulations or employment contracts may provide for pay or benefits to employees over and above the rights set out in the Act. 12. Pursuant to clause 30a(1.2), an employee shall be entitled to additional pay, including to holiday pay, which shall amount to a monthly average wage in the relevant industrial sector. Holiday pay shall be paid in full to employees who are entitled to 18 days of annual leave, and shall be reduced proportionally if the employee is entitled to fewer days of annual leave. 13. The text of clause 4(2) of this agreement corresponds to clause 30 of the 2001 Agreement. 14. The text of clause 116(1) of this agreement corresponds to clause 30 of the 2001 Agreement. Additionally, clause 116(4) provides that in case of its financial inability to pay holiday pay as a lump sum, the employer may pay it in several instalments.",1,589

The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant's wife died on 2 July 2000. His claim for widows' benefits was made on 7 July 2000 and was rejected on 14 July 2000 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows' benefits because he was not a woman. On 24 July 2000 the applicant appealed and on 29 August 2000 reconsideration took place. The previous decision was upheld. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law. The domestic law relevant to this application is set out in Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, §§ 1426, ECHR 2002-IV and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, §§ 40-41, 25 July 2007.",0,200
271,271,"The applicant, İbrahim Cağlayan, is a Turkish national, who was born in 1952 and lives in Istanbul. He was represented before the Court by Mr Kocak, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In 1992, the General Directorate of National Roads and Highways (Devlet Karayolları Genel Müdürlüğü), a state body responsible, inter alia, for motorway construction, expropriated a plot of land belonging to the applicant in İstanbul. A committee of experts assessed the value of the plot of land and this amount was paid to the applicant when the expropriation took place. On 25 November 1997, following the applicant’s request for increased compensation, the Pendik Civil Court of General Jurisdiction awarded him an additional compensation of 1,479,600,000 Turkish liras (TRL) plus an interest at the statutory rate of 30 % per annum. On 9 March 1998 the Court of Cassation upheld the decision of the firstinstance court. The due amount, which was 2,501,918,000 Turkish liras (TRL) including the interest, was paid to the applicant on 26 May 1998. Under Law no. 3095 of 4 December 1984 the rate of interest on overdue State debts was set at 30% per annum. As of 1 January 1998 the statutory rate of interest was increased to 50%. The statutory rate of interest was set at the compound interest rate, namely 60% as of 1 January 2000. A description of further relevant domestic law may be found in the Aka v. Turkey, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VI, §§ 17-25; Akkuş v. Turkey, judgment of 9 July 1997, Reports 1997-IV, §§ 13-16.",0,276

On 12 June 1991 the applicant applied to the Salzburg District Agricultural Authority (Agrarbezirksbehörde, the ""District Authority"") for declarations (1) that the share in an agricultural association (Agrargemeinschaft) represented by a certain parcel of land (""the share"") belonged to him, and (2) that grazing rights in that parcel (""the grazing rights"") also belonged to him. On 24 June 1991 the District Authority found that the applicant had not made out his claims, and it declared that the share and the grazing rights belonged to a third person. The applicant appealed to the Regional Land Reform Board (Landesagrarsenat, the ""Regional Board""). 9. The Regional Board dismissed the applicant's appeal on 8 May 1992. After an oral hearing, it found, so far as relevant, that the share had passed with a transfer of the land to a third party in 1949 (as rectified in 1952). The question of the grazing rights had to be determined by reference to the ownership of the land on 29 April 1868, as that was the last time they were officially mentioned. In the absence of any express alienation of the grazing rights since then, the grazing rights passed with the land - that is, the applicant did not own them. 10. The Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof) declined to deal with the applicant's constitutional complaint on 14 October 1992. It remitted the case to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof). 11. On 14 March 1995 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint rejecting at the same time, in accordance with section 39(2) no. 6 of the Administrative Court Act (Verwaltungsgerichtshofgesetz), the applicant’s request for an oral hearing. The judgment was served on the applicant’s representative on 31 March 1995. 12.

On 6 October 1997 the applicant was apprehended by police officers B.Y.Y. and L.G.T. On the same day he was brought to the medical sobering-up facility by these officers. In the course of the applicant’s apprehension the police officers inflicted bodily injuries on him, resulting in a short-term health disorder. 8. On 7 October 1997 the applicant was charged with assaulting and attempting to bribe them. 9. On 21 October 1997 the Leninsky District Court of Zaporizzhia acquitted the applicant. 10. The applicant complained to the Regional Prosecution Service and the General Prosecution Service seeking to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers who had unlawfully apprehended and harmed him. 11. On 12 February 1998 the applicant initiated civil proceedings against the Zaporizzhia City Police Department in the Leninsky District Court of Zaporizzhia, seeking compensation for the moral damage caused by the actions of B.Y.Y. and L.G.T. 12. On 9 March 1998 the Prosecution Service of Zaporizzhia instituted criminal proceedings against the officers. 13. On 29 January 1999 the Leninsky District Court of Zaporizzhia sentenced B.Y.Y. and L.G.T. to a 3 year suspended prison sentence following their conviction for abuse of power and inflicting bodily harm on the applicant. It also ordered the Zaporizzhia City Police Department to pay the applicant UAH 3,709.13 in compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. 14. On 22 March 1999 the Zaporizzhia Regional Court upheld that decision. 15. On 1 April 1999 the Leninsky District Court of Zaporizzhia initiated the execution proceedings for the judgment of 29 January 1999. 16. On 14 April 1999 the writ of execution was lodged with the Leninsky District Bailiffs’ Service in Zaporizzhia. 17. On 20 May 1999 the respondent in the case was changed from the City Police Department of Zaporizzhia to the Regional Police Department of Zaporizzhia, because the latter was responsible for managing the medical sobering-up facilities. 18. On 27 July 1999 the writ of execution was transferred to the Ordzhonikidze Bailiffs’ Service for further enforcement. 19. In August 1999 the State Treasury Department confirmed the lack of funds of the Regional Police Department. 20. On 16 August 1999 the applicant lodged a motion to attach the property of the Zaporizzhia Regional Police Department. 21. On 14 September 1999 the Ordzhonikidze District Execution Service of Zaporizzhia informed the applicant that the attachment of the property of a State institution was prohibited by law. 22. On 3 November 1999 the Ordzhonikidze District Execution Service informed the applicant of the Zaporizzhia Regional Police Department’s lack of funds. It also stated that the latter owned no property and therefore attachment was not possible. 23. During 1999-2000, the applicant repeatedly lodged a number of motions with the Prosecution Service of Zaporizzia, the General Prosecution Service, the State Security Service, the Supreme Court of Ukraine and the Human Rights Ombudsman, seeking to institute criminal proceedings against various officials of the Zaporizzhia Regional Police Department, the execution service officials, Judge D.L.A of the Leninsky District Court, and a private person, D.S.S., who had allegedly assaulted the applicant. 24. On 5 April 2000 the Ordzhonikidze District Bailiffs’ Service terminated the proceedings in the applicant’s case due to the lack of funds of the Zaporizzhia Regional Police Department. The Government mentioned that the applicant retained a right to reintroduce the writ of execution with the Bailiffs’ Service for up to three years. 25. On 17 November 2000 the Deputy President of the Supreme Court of Ukraine refused to initiate supervisory review proceedings in the applicant’s case. It also remitted the applicant’s claims concerning the non-execution of the judicial decision to the Ministry of Justice. 26. On 9 June 2003 the Ordzhonikidze District Bailiffs’ Service issued resolution no. 1131/9 concerning the institution of the enforcement proceedings for the judgment of 29 January 1999. It also proposed to the debtor that it enforce the judgment given in the applicant’s favour voluntarily. On the same date the resolution instituting the criminal proceedings was sent to the Zaporizzhia Regional Police Department and to the applicant. 27. On 20 June 2003 the bailiff requested the State Treasury to transfer the funds awarded to the applicant by the judgment of 29 January 1999 to his account. 28. On 7 August 2003 the applicant requested that the funds be transferred to his account. 29. On 14 August 2003 the judgment of 29 January 1999 was enforced and the applicant received UAH 3,709.13. 30. On 20 November 2003 the Ordzhonikidze Bailiffs’ Service terminated the execution proceedings in the case in view of the fact that the judgment of 29 January 1999 had been enforced in full. 31.

On 7 August 2001 he lodged a criminal complaint against E.I., claiming that she had stolen certain items from his flat. He stated that E.I. regularly came to his flat to clean it and that on 20 January 2001 she had removed several items of jewellery and clothing from his flat. He had only realised in July 2001 that those items had disappeared from his flat. 8. The case was heard by the Drăgăşani District Court, which delivered its first-instance judgment on 14 January 2002 finding E.I. guilty and sentencing her to three months’ imprisonment, suspended. E.I. was ordered to pay the applicant damages of 10,000,000 Romanian lei (ROL – approximately 350 euros (EUR) at the time), representing the estimated value of the stolen items, and ROL 2,500,000 (approximately EUR 90) in legal fees. The District Court based its decision on the statements of the parties and of two witnesses. According to one of the witnesses, the applicant had complained to him in July 2001 that several items were missing from his flat. According to the second witness, in February 2001 the defendant had shown him several items of jewellery and clothing, mentioning that she had received them as a gift from the applicant. 9. On 1 April 2002 the Vâlcea County Court dismissed an appeal by E.I. and the judgment of 14 January 2002 thus became final and enforceable. 10. On an unspecified date the Prosecutor General of Romania lodged an extraordinary appeal (recurs in anulare) against the judgment of 14 January 2002. The Prosecutor General argued that E.I. had been wrongfully convicted, as none of the evidence adduced was conclusive as to her guilt. This had led to a breach of her right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty. The prosecutor also indicated that E.I. had submitted two pieces of evidence as part of her defence which had been ignored in the ordinary proceedings. One of the documents was a request lodged by the applicant to the owners’ association in which he sought an exemption from utility costs for the period December 2000-April 2001, when he would be away in the United Kingdom. This document was relevant, as the applicant stated that E.I. entered his flat only when he was there and he had declared that the items had been stolen on the exact date of 20 January 2001, when, according to that document, he was not in Romania. The second document was a report of a search conducted by the police at the home of the defendant, which indicated that none of the items claimed to have been stolen from the applicant’s flat had been found there. 11. In a decision of 4 November 2003 the High Court of Cassation and Justice allowed the extraordinary appeal, quashed the judgments of 14 January and 1 April 2002, acquitted E.I. and relieved her of the obligation to pay the applicant compensation for the stolen items and the legal costs. The court held that the prior conviction had been based on the statements of two witnesses who declared that they knew that E.I. was doing housework for the applicant, that he owned the items mentioned in his criminal complaint and that after 20 January 2001 some of the items were seen by one of the witnesses in the house of E.I. Nevertheless, the court indicated that these statements were contradicted by the evidence in the case file indicating that the applicant had been away from Romania between December 2000 and April 2001. Furthermore, taking into account that he had always stated that E.I. only did housework in his flat when he was there, the court indicated that his submission that he had not noticed E.I. leaving the flat with so many items was not credible. The court further concluded that the evidence adduced in the case was both contradictory and inconclusive in respect of the date the alleged theft was committed and of whether the defendant had committed the theft. It therefore quashed the earlier decisions on the ground that they had not been lawful and acquitted E.I. of all charges, relieving her also of the obligation to pay compensation for the stolen items and for the court costs incurred by the applicant. 12. The applicant attended the hearing and submitted his arguments in support of his claims. 13. For a summary of the relevant domestic-law provisions concerning this type of extraordinary appeal (recurs in anulare) see the judgment in the case of Precup v. Romania (no. 17771/03, § 15, 27 January 2009).",0,769
275,275,"4. The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Bratislava. 5. On 15 March 1996 the applicant sued a limited company before the Bratislava II District Court. He claimed royalties for a furniture line which he had designed. 6. On 12 February 1997 the District Court granted the applicant’s request that a second company should be joined to the proceedings as a defendant. On 23 May 1997 the Regional Court in Bratislava upheld that decision. 7. As the first defendant was declared insolvent, the applicant withdrew his claim against it on 2 June 1998. That company was subsequently deleted from the companies register. 8. On 18 September 1998 the Bratislava II District Court decided to transfer the case to the District Court in Žilina. On 30 November 1998 the Supreme Court decided that the case fell within the jurisdiction of the Bratislava II District Court. 9. Between 22 April 1999 and 2 October 2001 the District Court scheduled eleven hearings. The defendant’s representative failed to appear on seven occasions. 10. On 2 October 2001 the District Court dismissed the applicant’s claim. On 12 December 2001 the applicant appealed. 11. On 16 October 2003 the Bratislava Regional Court quashed the first-instance judgment. The court of appeal held that the applicant was entitled to remuneration for the design in question. Further evidence was to be taken with a view to determining the amount. 12. Between 5 March 2004 and 15 April 2004 the file was examined by the Constitutional Court. 13. On 26 April 2004 the case was assigned to a different judge of the District Court. 14. On 16 July 2004, the District Court appointed an expert. As the expert stated that he was not competent in the area concerned, a different expert was appointed on 27 August 2004. On account of the latter’s health problems, a third expert was appointed on 22 November 2004. The third expert informed the District Court that he was not qualified to determine remuneration for artistic design, and for this reason a fourth expert was appointed on 22 April 2005. That expert informed the court that she was not authorised to prepare an opinion on the point in issue. On 7 November 2005 the Bratislava II District Court appointed a fifth expert with a view to having determined the remuneration due to the applicant. On 7 December 2005 that expert replied that he was not entitled to give an opinion on the point in issue. On 9 January 2005 the court asked the second expert, who had earlier stated that he was suffering from health problems, whether he could submit an opinion. He replied in the negative. 15. On 10 July 2006 the judge made a note in the file indicating that it had been impossible to find an expert in intellectual property who was qualified to determine royalties for the design of office furniture. 16. On 19 July 2006 the District Court asked five companies for information on royalties paid to furniture designers. It repeated the request on 26 September 2006. 17. In November and December 2006 the court sent a similar request to the Slovak Chamber of Architects, the School of Creative Arts, the Slovak Design Centre and the Slovak Fund of Creative Arts. In March 2007 and April 2007 the court urged the School of Creative Arts to submit the information. 18. On 14 June 2007 the District Court held a hearing. The applicant was asked to submit documentary evidence concerning the use by the defendant of the furniture line designed by him. The applicant submitted the evidence on 20 June 2007. 19. On 22 October 2007 the District Court appointed an expert in household equipment and furniture and asked him to submit an opinion within forty days. That expert has been registered in the list of experts, translators and interpreters of the Ministry of Justice since 1988. He submitted the opinion on 3 January 2008. On 28 January 2008 the District Court decided on the expert’s fees. 20. The proceedings are pending. 21. On 6 March 2003 the applicant complained to the Constitutional Court that the Bratislava II District Court and the Bratislava Regional Court had violated his right under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention to a hearing within a reasonable time. 22. On 3 June 2004 the Constitutional Court found that the District Court had violated the applicant’s right in issue. The case was of a certain complexity in that expert evidence was required. The applicant had not contributed by his conduct to the length of the proceedings. The defendant had failed to appear at seven hearings, which had resulted in the proceedings being prolonged. The District Court had not proceeded with the case in a smooth and efficient manner, as a result of which the applicant’s claim had not yet been determined. 23. The Constitutional Court ordered the District Court to proceed with the case without further delay and awarded the applicant 20,000 Slovak korunas (the equivalent of 500 euros at that time) in just satisfaction. It also ordered the District Court to reimburse the applicant’s costs.",1,851
279,279,"4. The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Žabokreky. 5. 6. On 9 June 1995 the applicant filed an action with the Martin District Court. He claimed the ownership and restitution of a motor car. 7. On 10 October 2003 the applicant modified his claim and asked for leave to join another person as a defendant. The District Court granted the request. 8. On 5 December 2003 the District Court remitted the case file to the Žilina Regional Court which decided on the defendant's appeal on 26 January 2004. 9. On 13 July 2004 an expert was asked to prepare an opinion. The expert opinion was submitted on 27 April 2006. 10. On 8 June 2006 the Constitutional Court found that the District Court had violated the applicant's right under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention to a hearing within a reasonable time. 11. The Constitutional Court held that the case was not particularly complex and that the applicant by his conduct had not contributed to the length of the proceedings. Substantial delays imputable to the District Court had occurred. The proceedings had lasted 11 years and no decision had been delivered on the merits. 12. The Constitutional Court awarded 80,000 Slovakian korunas (SKK) to the applicant as just satisfaction in respect of non-pecuniary damage. It also ordered the District Court to avoid any further delay in the proceedings and to reimburse the applicant's legal costs. 13. On 12 October 2006 the District Court dismissed the applicant's claim. The applicant appealed. 14. On 31 October 2007 the Žilina Regional Court upheld the judgment. The decision became final on 27 February 2008.",1,274
284,284,"5. In February 1994 the Hungarian National Bank authorised a private limited company (“the Company”) to issue payment cards to its customers. After 1995, however, purchase with such cards was no longer possible. Despite this fact, in 1996 the applicants concluded agreements with the Company for so-called “savings cards” in which they invested various amounts of money. 6. In November 1996 bankruptcy proceedings were initiated against the Company and its insolvency was established in June 1997. The applicants recovered part of their investments through partial reimbursement by the Company. They sold their remaining claims against the Company to third parties. 7. On 26 October 1998 three hundred and thirty private individuals, including the applicants, who were all represented by one law firm, brought an official liability action against the Hungarian National Bank before the Budapest Regional Court. They claimed that the respondent had not exercised its supervisory duties over the Company, therefore making it possible for the applicants to conclude the above-mentioned agreements which had resulted in substantial losses. 8. On 11 January 2001 the Regional Court dismissed their action, finding that the respondent had no duty of supervision according to the relevant domestic legislation. 9. On 28 January 2003 the Supreme Court, acting as a second-instance court, quashed the Regional Court’s decision and remitted the case to the first instance court due to the incomplete findings of fact. 10. In the resumed proceedings the Budapest Regional Court found for the applicants on 6 December 2005. It established that the Company had unlawfully overstepped the boundaries of its activities, which had been known to the respondent; nevertheless, the latter could not prove that it had fulfilled its supervisory duties in this respect. 11. On 26 October 2006 the Budapest Court of Appeal dismissed their appeal. It acknowledged that there were omissions on the respondent’s side. However, since the applicants had already sold their claims to third parties, the court held that they could have no substantive claims whatsoever in the circumstances. 12. The applicants lodged a petition for review with the Supreme Court. It upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision on 5 June 2007, finding that the latter decision had been in compliance with the law.",1,366
286,286,"4. The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in Orašje, Bosnia and Herzegovina. 5. On 25 November 1994 the applicant brought a civil action against the company V. (“the employer”) and the insurance company C.O. in the Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu) seeking damages for a work-related injury in the amount of 96,700 Croatian kunas (HRK). 6. The court held hearings on 2 June and 30 November 1999 and 21 February 2001. 7. In the period between May 1998 and October 2000 the applicant filed four rush notes urging the court to schedule a hearing and speed up the proceedings. 8. On 21 February 2001 the Municipal Court gave judgment dismissing the applicant’s claim. The applicant appealed on 6 March 2001 to the Zagreb County Court (Županijski sud u Zagrebu). 9. On 26 March 2001 the applicant applied to be exempted from the court fee for the appeal. Since it was the Municipal Court that was competent to decide on the applicant’s request for exemption, the County Court returned the case-file to it with a view to reaching a decision thereon. A hearing before the Municipal Court scheduled for 14 January 2003 was adjourned since the applicant had not received the summons due to his change of address. The next hearing scheduled for 3 June 2003 was adjourned owing to the illness of the judge assigned to hear the case. Lastly, a hearing at which the applicant gave a declaration of his income and assets was held on 13 May 2004. On 24 May 2004 the applicant was served with the decision in his favour exempting him from the court fee for the appeal. The case-file was then sent back to the County Court with a view to deciding on the applicant’s appeal. 10. On 5 April 2005 the County Court dismissed the appeal. The judgment was served on the applicant on 25 April 2005. No appeal on points of law (revizija) lay to the Supreme Court against this judgment (see paragraph 14 below). 11. Meanwhile, on 23 July 2002 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) complaining about the length of the civil proceedings. 12. On 17 April 2003 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. It held that the delay was attributable to the complexity of the case and the applicant’s conduct. It found that the applicant had contributed to the length of the proceedings in that he had applied for exemption from the court fee only after he had appealed against the first-instance judgment. 13. The relevant part of section 63 of the Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court (Ustavni zakon o Ustavnom sudu Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette no. 49/2002 of 3 May 2002 – “the Constitutional Court Act”) reads as follows: “(1) The Constitutional Court shall examine a constitutional complaint whether or not all legal remedies have been exhausted if the competent court fails to decide a claim concerning the applicant’s rights and obligations or a criminal charge against him or her within a reasonable time ... (2) If a constitutional complaint ... under paragraph 1 of this section is upheld, the Constitutional Court shall set a time-limit within which the competent court must decide the case on the merits... (3) In a decision issued under paragraph 2 of this section, the Constitutional Court shall assess appropriate compensation for the applicant for the violation of his or her constitutional rights ... The compensation shall be paid out of the State budget within three months from the date a request for payment is lodged.” 14. On 6 November 1999 the Amendments to the Civil Procedure Act (Zakon o izmjenama i dopunama Zakona o parničnom postupku, Official Gazette no. 112/1999 of 29 October 1999) entered into force. They raised the statutory threshold for lodging an appeal on points of law (revizija) to the Supreme Court from HRK 3,000 to 100,000. That is to say that, from then on, for such an appeal to be admissible ratione valoris in non-commercial matters, the value of the subject matter in dispute had to exceed the last-mentioned amount. The Amendments also provided for their immediate application to pending proceedings except to those cases in which an appeal on points of law had already been lodged.",1,713
287,287,"The applicant, Mr Karel Des Fours Walderode, was a Czech and Austrian national. He was born in 1904 and died on 6 February 2000. On 25 February 2000 the applicant's widow, Mrs Johanna Kammerlander, took her late husband's place in the proceedings before the Court. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. The applicant's stepmother and his two stepbrothers, all German nationals, owned real estate in former Czechoslovakia. In 1945 the property was confiscated under Presidential Decrees nos. 12/1945 and 108/1945, which entered into force on 21 June and 25 October 1945 respectively. The applicant's stepmother died in 1955 leaving her real estate to the applicant, and conferring the succession rights of her deceased sons on the applicant. She had never acquired Czechoslovak citizenship. The applicant left Czechoslovakia in 1949, thereby forfeiting his Czechoslovak citizenship, and returned in 1991. He was granted Czech citizenship in August 1992. On 14 July 1992 the applicant lodged a claim for restitution of the property confiscated from his stepmother and stepbrothers under Presidential Decree no. 12/1945 and which had been sold by his father before the Second World War. He referred to the Land Ownership Act of 1991, claiming that he had inherited the property. On 6 February 1995 the Jablonec nad Nisou Land Office, referring to the documentary evidence, dismissed his claim on the ground that his stepmother and stepbrothers had not been loyal to the Czechoslovak State during the German occupation and had not acquired Czechoslovak citizenship after the Second World War. It found, with reference to section 2(1) of the Restitution Act 1992, that the applicant was not the owner of the property, as his stepmother and stepbrothers had not satisfied the requirements for restitution, and that the applicant's claim in respect of his father's former property fell outside the scope of the restitution legislation. On 16 April 1996 the Municipal Court, having assessed a substantial amount of documentary evidence and having heard the parties to the dispute, upheld the Land Office's decision. It stated, inter alia, that under Article 819 of the General Civil Code of 1811 an heir acquired an estate only upon its distribution; thus the dates of the acquisition of the estate and the death of a testator were different. In fact, from the death of a testator until the time of distribution of the estate, the property was to be regarded as hereditas iacens. According to the court, real estate could be lawfully confiscated in the period between the death of the testator and the time of acceptance of the estate by an heir. The court held that the property at issue had been confiscated ex lege by Presidential Decree no. 12/1945 from the applicant's stepbrothers, German nationals, after they had died but whilst they had still been the notional owners of the estate. As the original owners, including the applicant's stepmother, had not reacquired Czech citizenship as provided for in section 2(1) of the Restitution Act 1992, the applicant could not be considered to be entitled to restitution. On 5 June 1997 the Constitutional Court dismissed a constitutional appeal by the applicant as unsubstantiated, stating in particular that, under the Civil Code of 1811, which had been applicable at the relevant time, an heir acquired the estate upon its distribution. In the present case the time of acquisition of the estate and the death of the testator did not fall within the same period. In order to transfer the estate to an heir, special proceedings before the national courts had to be instituted of the court's own motion. If such proceedings were not instituted, the estate was hereditas iacens until delivery of a court judgment. Heirs who wished to acquire the estate had to submit an application within the framework of those proceedings. The estate was considered to remain in the possession of the testator until acquired by an heir. The court observed that, in the present case, the confiscation had taken place when the applicant's stepbrothers died. However, the estate had not yet been administered by the national authorities and, therefore, the applicant had not acquired the property at issue. Moreover, as the stepbrothers had not been entitled to claim restitution of the property under the Land Ownership Act, and since the applicant's stepmother had been of German origin and had never acquired Czechoslovak citizenship, the applicant himself was not entitled to claim restitution pursuant to this Act. (a) In 1995 the applicant instituted inheritance proceedings in Germany in respect of the property claimed in the above restitution proceedings. On 7 June 1995 two certificates of succession were issued to the effect that the applicant was the universal heir of his stepbrothers. (b) On 3 March 1995 the relevant German authority issued a document certifying that the applicant's stepbrothers had not served in the SS. (c) The applicant was the owner of real estate in Hrubý Rohožec. This was confiscated from him under Presidential Decree no. 12/1945. In August 1945 the former local authority acknowledged the confiscation and granted him leave to appeal to the Prague National Land Committee. (d) On 2 November 2001 the United Nations Human Rights Committee, considering the applicant's communication (no. 747/1997) concerning the Hrubý Rohožec real estate, held that Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, read in conjunction with Article 2 of the Covenant, had been violated by the Czech Republic.",0,905
288,288,"4. The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in the town of Novovoronezh in the Voronezh Region. 5. The applicant was entitled to a disability allowance and commodity benefits. She sued the local Social Security Committee for the unpaid allowance and benefits, and claimed their re-adjustment. 6. By judgment of 16 July 2003, the Novovoronezh Town Court of the Voronezh Region awarded the applicant 22,109.75 Russian roubles (RUB) for the period from 1 July 2002 to 31 July 2003. On 14 October 2003 the Voronezh Regional Court upheld the judgment. The applicant received the money due to her on 7 June 2005. On 5 September 2005 the Town Court awarded the applicant RUB 5,552.02 as compensation for inflationary losses caused by the delay in the enforcement of the judgment of 16 July 2003, as upheld on 14 October 2003. It appears that the compensation award has not been paid to the applicant. 7. By judgment of 5 January 2004, the Town Court awarded the applicant RUB 13,971.25 for the period from 1 August to 31 December 2003. This judgment became final on 15 January 2004. It was enforced on 4 August 2005. 8. On 15 April 2004 the Town Court increased the applicant’s monthly allowance to RUB 5,664.84 and awarded her RUB 9,494.52 in arrears for the period from 1 January to 31 March 2004. The judgment became final on 26 April 2004. It was enforced on 25 August 2005. 9. On 30 September 2004 the Town Court awarded the applicant RUB 9,494.52. On 11 October 2004 the judgment became final. The applicant received the money on 25 August 2005. 10. By judgment of 15 November 2005, the Town Court awarded RUB 5,700.35 as compensation for inflationary losses in respect of the sums awarded to the applicant on 5 January, 15 April and 30 September 2004. It appears that the compensation award has not been paid to the applicant. 11. By judgment of 16 February 2004, the Town Court awarded the applicant RUB 4,973.57. The judgment became final on 26 February 2004. Apparently, it remains without enforcement. 12. On 6 September 2004 the Town Court awarded RUB 2,272.30 to the applicant and increased her monthly commodity benefits to RUB 679.78. The judgment became final on 17 September 2004. It appears that on 16 July 2004 the applicant received RUB 500 in execution of that judgment.",1,396
300,300,"4. The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Pskov, a town in the Pskov Region. 5. As a victim of Chernobyl, the applicant is entitled to social benefits. Considering himself underpaid, he brought six successful actions against local authorities responsible for welfare. 6. On 13 August 2002 the Pskov Town Court fixed a new amount of periodic benefits. This judgment became binding on 24 September 2002. According to the Government, this judgment was fully enforced by 31 December 2006. According to the applicant, this judgment has still not been enforced, because from 1 January 2007 the periodic benefits were reduced again. 7. On 11 June 2003 the Town Court awarded 15,000 Russian roubles (“RUB”) as interest for delayed payment. This judgment became binding on 15 July 2003. On the welfare authority’s request, on 20 February 2004 the Presidium of the Pskov Regional Court quashed the judgment on supervisory review, on the ground of misapplication of material law. 8. On 21 July 2003 the Justice of the Peace of Court District 31 of Pskov awarded RUB 3,000 as interest for delayed payment. This judgment became binding on 9 October 2003. On the welfare authority’s request, on 14 May 2004 the Presidium of the Pskov Regional Court quashed the judgment on supervisory review, on the ground of misapplication of material law. 9. On 28 October 2003 the Town Court awarded arrears and fixed a new amount of periodic payments. This judgment became binding on 10 November 2003. According to the Government, this judgment was fully enforced by 31 December 2005. According to the applicant, this judgment has still not been enforced, because the periodic payments continue to be miscalculated. 10. On 29 December 2003 the Town Court awarded compensation of inflationary loss caused by the delayed enforcement of an earlier judgment. This judgment became binding on 9 January 2004 and was enforced on 8 July 2005. 11. On 1 June 2005 the Town Court ordered the applicant to be provided in 2005 with a decent flat of at least 65 m². This judgment became final on 15 June 2005 and was enforced on 29 December 2006. 12. Under section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997, a bailiff must enforce a judgment within two months. Under section 242.2.6 of the Budget Code of 31 July 1998, the Ministry of Finance must enforce a judgment within three months.",1,402
301,301,"The applicant, Mr John Higham, is a British national who was born in 1943 and lives in Kent. He was represented before the Court by Royds Rdw, solicitors in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant’s wife died on 5 September 1997. On 20 June 2000, the applicant made a claim for widows’ benefits. On 6 July 2000, the applicant was informed that his claim had been disallowed as he was not a woman. On 28 July 2000 the applicant made a request for reconsideration. On 18 August 2000 his claim was reconsidered but the decision remained unchanged. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefit was payable to widowers under United Kingdom law. The domestic law relevant to this application is set out in Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, §§ 40-41, 25 July 2007.",0,189
304,304,"4. The applicant was born in 1925 and lives in Praszka. 5. On 28 March 1991 the applicant lodged a motion with the Oleśno District Court, claiming a division of inheritance and dissolution of co-ownership of a certain property. 6. The court held hearings on: 15 May 1991, 28 August 1991, 29 January 1992, 10 April 1992, 18 May 1992, 24 August 1992, 30 September 1992, 23 February 1993, 7 June 1993 and 28 March 1994. 7. Having regard to the lack of progress in the proceedings, and apparently aiming at obtaining possession of the property by other legal means, on 13 April 1993 the applicant lodged a motion with the Oleśno District Court, claiming acquisitive prescription of half of the property in question. By a decision of 11 May 1994 the Oleśno District Court dismissed her motion. By a decision of 27 September 1994 the Częstochowa Regional Court dismissed her further appeal and upheld the contested decision. 8. Further hearings in the dissolution case were held on 3 June 1998, 30 December 1999, 29 March 2000 and 23 May 2000. 9. The court ordered a number of expert opinions. They were submitted to the court on: 22 December 1991, 3 July 1992, 8 September 1997, 12 May 1998, 16 June 1998, 9 December 1998, 9 February 1999, 16 April 1999, 11 May 1999, 8 October 1999 and 27 November 2000. 10. By a decision of 10 January 2001 the Oleśno District Court stayed the proceedings due to the fact that one of the parties to the proceedings had died. By virtue of the same decision the court resumed the proceedings, having regard to his heirs' request that the proceedings be resumed. 11. On 3 June 2003 the Oleśno District Court gave a judgment on the merits. 12. On 16 December 2003 the Opole Regional Court dismissed the applicant's appeal. 13. By a decision of 28 June 2004 the Supreme Court declined to examine the cassation appeal, considering that it had not been shown that arguable public interest grounds existed which would justify the examination of the appeal.",1,348
307,307,"The applicant, Mr Remzi Balcı, is a Turkish national who was born in 1934 and lives in Samsun. He had been granted legal aid and was represented before the Court by Mr C. Balcı, a lawyer practising in Samsun. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the Convention proceedings. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In 1971 the applicant bought a plot of arable land from a fellow villager. The seller had held the land in his possession for over thirty years without a title deed. The transaction took place unofficially and the parties did not execute a written sale agreement. In 1974 the authorities conducted regional cadastral works in the area. As a result, the plot in question was registered in the land register as two separate parcels, numbered 370 and 590. Parcel no. 370 was registered in the name of the applicant as an arable field based on witness statements confirming that he had had taken it over from its previous possessor and had been exploiting it without interruption ever since. Parcel no. 590 however was classified as part of an adjacent forest. As the legislation permitted no private ownership of forest land, this parcel was registered in the name of the Treasury as a State property. According to the applicant, he was uninformed about this registration and continued to cultivate not only parcel no. 370 but no. 590. He only became aware of the situation in 1983, when the authorities discovered the cultivation and fined him for illegal utilisation of State property. On 26 December 1983 the applicant initiated civil proceedings before the Samsun Civil Court, requesting parcel no. 590 to be registered in his name. A court-appointed expert conducted an inspection and concluded that parcel no. 590 could not be characterised as forest land. Agreeing with the expert, the Samsun Civil Court ruled in favour of the applicant on 8 December 1995. The court also established that the applicant had been holding the parcel in his uncontested and uninterrupted possession for long enough to entitle him to claim title under the applicable legislation. Accordingly, the court recognised him as the lawful owner of the parcel. On 6 February 1997, however, the Court of Cassation quashed this judgment. It established that older land inventories proved that the disputed parcel was on the outer limits of a neighbouring forest. The court reasoned that many years of intensive cultivation must have removed the natural flora. Despite such a transformation, the court considered that the land should be considered as despoiled forest which had never belonged to the applicant. Accordingly, it directed the civil court to re-examine the facts of the case and pass judgment accordingly. On 13 March 1998 the Samsun Civil Court adhered to this ruling. It held that the revision of the local plan served the general interest given that parcel no. 590 was a forest area and that the applicant had illegally occupied it by expanding the boundaries of his lawfully possessed land, i.e. plot no. 370. On 8 July 1998 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal. On 29 May 2000 the Treasury sold the plot of land in question to a third party as an arable field. Article 713 of the Turkish Civil Code provides that, persons who hold in their possession an unregistered immovable property without interruption or legal challenge for a minimum period of 20 years, are entitled to request its registration in their names.",0,587

A committee of experts assessed the value of the plot of land and the relevant amount was paid to her. 6. Following the applicant’s request for increased compensation, on 14 July 1997 the Bursa Civil Court of First-instance awarded her additional compensation plus interest at the statutory rate. 7. On 14 October 1997 the Court of Cassation held a hearing and quashed the judgment of the First-instance court. 8. On 27 April 1998 the Bursa Civil Court of First-instance awarded the applicant additional compensation of 3,591,690,496 Turkish liras (TRL) plus interest at the statutory rate, running from 29 August 1996, applicable at the date of the court’s decision. 9. On 7 July 1998 the Court of Cassation held a hearing and upheld the judgment of the Bursa Civil Court of First-instance. 10. On 6 October 1998 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s request for rectification. 11. On 29 December 1998 the National Water Board paid TRL 7,101,232,000 to the applicant. 12. The relevant domestic law and practice is described in the Aka v. Turkey judgment of 23 September 1998 (Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998VI, §§ 17-23).

310,310,"The applicant, Mr Livius Popovici, is an Austrian national who was born in 1927 and lives in Vienna. He was represented by Mr Reif-Breitwieser, a lawyer practising in Vienna. The Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ambassador H. Tichy, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. By a decision of the Tax Authority (Finanzamt) of 9 December 2002 the applicant was ordered to pay a “first surcharge” for the late payment of his income tax (erster Säumniszuschlag) for the years 1996, 1997 and 1998. The Tax Authority held that the applicant had failed to pay the taxes by their due date of 11 November 2002. By letters dated 17 and 18 December 2002 the applicant appealed against the decisions regarding the surcharges for income tax for 1996 and 1998 respectively. The surcharges amounted to 2% of the outstanding taxes, totalling 137.91 euros (EUR). By a decision of 3 June 2003 the Independent Financial Panel (Unabhängiger Finanzsenat – “the IFP”) dismissed the applicant’s appeals as ill-founded and upheld the decision of 9 December 2002. The applicant, who was in receipt of legal aid, complained to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof) on 29 September 2003, arguing that the law applicable at the time the tax surcharges were due, did not provide for “first surcharges”, but only for “surcharges”. On 18 November 2004 the IFP submitted comments on the applicant’s complaint. On 6 December 2004 the applicant submitted comments in reply. By a decision of 4 June 2008 the Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s complaint. It held that while the law in force at the time only provided for (one) surcharge, and “first”, “second” and “third” surcharges were only introduced by a later amendment to the law, the applicant had not suffered any disadvantage, as the substantive content of the law before and after the amendment was the same. The amount of the surcharge itself was the same under the law in force at the time as the amount of a “first” surcharge under the law after the amendment. It was only their denotation that had changed. The decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on 2 July 2008. On 4 March 2010 the applicant informed the Court that by a decision of the Tax Authority of 30 March 2009, the decision obliging him to pay surcharges had been annulled. Section 217 of the Federal Tax Act (Bundesabgabenordnung) deals with the imposition of surcharges for the late payment of taxes. The provision in force at the material time provided that the surcharge was to be fixed at 2% of the amount of tax not paid in time.",0,459

On 12 March 2003 the applicant purchased a recreation centre (“the centre”), comprising a group of cottages, from a private company. The centre was situated on a plot of land belonging to a collective farm. 7. The applicant asked the Registration Office to register the transfer of the title to the centre from the company to her. However, the applicant’s request was dismissed, because the company had not duly registered its title to the centre, and therefore was unable to transfer it to the applicant. 8. The applicant brought proceedings against the company seeking to obtain acknowledgement of her title to the centre. 9. On 7 April 2003 the Neklinovskiy District Court of the Rostov Region granted the applicant’s claim. 10. No ordinary appeal was lodged against the judgment. 11. On 18 April 2003 the judgment became final and enforceable. 12. On 23 June 2003 the Registration Office registered the applicant’s title to the centre. 13. On an unspecified date in 2003 the collective farm lodged an application for supervisory review of the judgment of 7 April 2003. It alleged that the said judgment was unfounded since, even though the collective farm owned the plot on which the centre in question was situated, it had not been invited to take part in the proceedings and its interests had not been taken into consideration by the domestic court. 14. On 3 December 2003 the Rostov Regional Court remitted the supervisory-review application for examination on its merits by the Presidium. 15. On 25 December 2003 the Presidium of the Rostov Regional Court held a supervisory-review hearing. It held that the first-instance court adopted the judgment with significant violations of substantive and procedural law. In particular, the Presidium pointed out that the first-instance court did not investigate that it failed to identify all the parties to the proceedings, to invite the owner of the land to participate in the proceedings and that it had pronounced judgment by which the rights of the latter were considerably affected. On these grounds the Presidium quashed the judgment of 7 April 2003 and remitted the matter for a fresh examination. 16. On 25 January 2005 the Neklinovskiy District Court of the Rostov Region dismissed the applicant’s claim, declared the purchase agreement void, annulled the registration of the applicant’s title to the centre and restored the parties to their original position. 17. On 30 March 2005 the Rostov Regional Court upheld the above judgment on appeal. 18. The Code of Civil Procedure of the Russian Federation (“the new Code”) was enacted on 14 November 2002 and replaced the RSFSR Code of Civil Procedure (“the old Code”) from 1 February 2003. It provides as follows: “1. Judicial decisions that have become legally binding, with the exception for judicial decisions by the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, may be appealed against ... to a court exercising supervisory review, by parties to the case and by other persons whose rights or legal interests have been adversely affected by these judicial decisions. 2. Judicial decisions may be appealed against to a court exercising supervisory review within one year after they became legally binding ...” “Judicial decisions of lower courts may be quashed or altered by way of supervisory review on the grounds of substantial violations of substantive or procedural legal provisions.” “1. Having examined the case by way of supervisory review, the court may ... (2) quash the judicial decision issued by a court of first, second or supervisory-review instance in whole or in part and remit the matter for a fresh examination; ... (5) quash or alter the judicial decision issued by a court of first, second or supervisory-review instance and issue a new judicial decision, without remitting the matter for a fresh examination, if substantive legal provisions have been erroneously applied or interpreted.”",0,652

He was represented before the Court by Mr Güney Dinç, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 3 May 1995 the applicant was arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of theft of electronic materials from his place of work. On 5 May 1995 he was brought before the public prosecutor and the Yatağan Magistrates’ Court. The applicant denied the accusations against him. He was conditionally released. On 26 May 1995 the public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment against the applicant for theft and requested that he be convicted and sentenced under Article 491 §§ 1 and 3 of the Criminal Code. On 17 April 1996 the Yatağan Magistrates’ Court convicted the applicant of theft and sentenced him to three years and six months’ imprisonment. On 29 April 1997 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the Yatağan Magistrates’ Court. On 17 June 1997 the applicant was arrested by the police and placed in prison to purge his sentence. On 21 May 1997 the judgment of the Court of Cassation was sent to the registry of the Yatağan Magistrates’ Court. On 2 June 1997 the applicant’s representative filed a petition with the Yatağan Magistrates’ Court and requested the re-opening of the proceedings and the suspension of the execution of the applicant’s sentence, pursuant to Articles 327 § 5 and 328 of the Criminal Code. In the aforementioned petition, the applicant’s representative stated, inter alia, the following: “The convict, Bayram Necdet Sarıbek, has been convicted on 17 April 1996 of theft... On 29 April 1997 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment (merits no. 1997/1331, judgment no.1432)...” On 4 June 1997 Yatağan Magistrates’ Court dismissed the applicant’s objections, against which decision the applicant’s representative again objected. On 17 June 1997 the applicant was arrested by the police and placed in prison to purge his sentence. On 18 June 1997 the Yatağan Criminal Court of First Instance dismissed the objections of the applicant. The applicant asked the Minister of Justice to issue a written order dismissing the judgment of the Yatağan Criminal Court of First Instance. On 23 September 1997 the Minister of Justice informed the Muğla public prosecutor that the request of the applicant had been refused. On 1 December 1997 the wife of the applicant requested a copy of the judgment of the Court of Cassation. On 3 March 1998 the applicant’s representative before the European Court of Human Rights filed a petition with the Yatağan Magistrates’ Court and asked whether the judgment of the Court of Cassation had been notified to the applicant or his lawyer. On 6 March 1998 the Yatağan Magistrates Court informed the applicant’s representative that the judgment of 29 April 1997 had not been notified to the applicant or his lawyer.",0,502

On 19 October 1994 her husband requested the court to find that the applicant was responsible for the marital breakdown. 10. On 1 September 1995 the court ordered the applicant's husband to pay 170 Polish zlotys (PLN) in family maintenance pending trial. 11. The court held twelve hearings on the following dates: 26 August, 6 December 1994; 31 January, 21 March, 16 May, 1 September, 28 November 1995; 9 January, 13 February, 19 March, 17 April and 26 April 1996. It heard evidence from at least twelve witnesses. 12. On 26 April 1996 the court granted a divorce decree. It considered that both spouses had been at fault in respect of the breakdown of their marriage. The court further vested custody rights over their minor child with the applicant and obliged her husband to pay maintenance for the child. 13. On 28 May 1996 the applicant filed an appeal against the above judgment. She claimed that her husband had been exclusively responsible for the failure of their marriage and that, therefore, divorce was inadmissible in law. 14. On 5 July 1996 the Wrocław Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case to the Wałbrzych Regional Court. 15. On 10 October 1996 the applicant filed a request for her maintenance claims to be secured. The court considered that further evidence regarding the financial situation of both parties should be obtained. 16. On 13 November 1996 the court held a hearing. On 9 April 1997 the court amended its decision of 1 September 1995 concerning the family maintenance pending trial, increasing it to PLN 250. It dismissed the remainder of the applicant's maintenance claims. 17.

319,319,"The applicant, Mr Colin Doyle, is a British national who was born in 1947 and lives in Brussels. The applicant moved to Belgium in 1983 where he has resided ever since. On 13 June 2006, he enquired about registering on the electoral role in the United Kingdom. On 11 July 2006 the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) stated that on the basis of the Representation of the People Act 2002 only nationals resident overseas for less than 15 years could register to vote in United Kingdom general and European elections. It was pointed out that he could be reinstated on the electoral role if he returned to live in the United Kingdom and that he was entitled to vote in the European elections in Belgium as a citizen of the European Union. It was also drawn to his attention that eligibility to vote in other countries generally depended on domestic law but that nationality was generally a requirement: he could therefore apply for Belgian nationality, or dual nationality if he did not wish to lose his British nationality. By way of general information, custom and practice was said to differ in European Union States, Danish citizens overseas losing the right to vote after 8-10 years and no overseas Irish citizen being allowed to vote at all. The Representation of the People Act 1985 provided for the first time for United Kingdom citizens living overseas to be able to register to vote in general and European Parliamentary elections in the United Kingdom. The applicable time-limit was five years, which was extended to 20 years by the Representation of People Act 1989 (entry into force 1990). The Representation of the People Act 2002, after debate in both Houses of Parliament, considered however that 15 years was a more appropriate period and the legislation was amended as from 1 April 2002).",0,308
320,320,"The applicants [Mr Jesús Santiago Tirado Ortiz and Mr Santiago Lozano Martin] are two Spanish nationals who were born in 1951 and 1965 respectively and live in Saragossa. They were represented before the Court by Mr E. Trebolle Lafuente, of the Saragossa Bar. At 11.35 p.m. on 15 June 1996 the applicant, who was driving on the motorway, had an argument with a toll-gate official about the amount he was to be charged for using the motorway. Shortly afterwards, some guardia civil officers, having been alerted by the toll-gate official, observed that the applicant was driving his car in zigzags. After stopping him, they noted that he appeared to be under the influence of alcohol. The applicant refused to submit to a breath test, despite being informed that his refusal might make him liable to prosecution under Article 380 of the Criminal Code for serious failure to obey the orders of a law-enforcement officer. An investigation was conducted, following which the applicant was committed for trial on charges of endangering other road-users and serious failure to obey orders. After adversarial proceedings the Saragossa Criminal Court no. 7, in a judgment of 19 November 1996 sentenced the applicant to a fine or, in default of payment, three months’ imprisonment, and disqualified him from driving for one year for endangering other road-users or jeopardising road safety contrary to Article 379 of the Criminal Code. It decided to refer to the Constitutional Court the question whether Article 380 of the Criminal Code, which made serious failure to obey the orders of an officer a criminal offence, was compatible with Article 24 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right not to make self-incriminating statements and not to confess guilt. The court accordingly, decided to stay its decision on the second charge until the Constitutional Court had ruled on the constitutionality of Article 380. The applicant appealed against his conviction on the charge of endangering other road-users, but it was upheld by the Saragossa Audiencia provincial on 29 November 1997. In a judgment delivered by a full court on 18 December 1997 the Constitutional Court held that Article 380 of the Criminal Code was compatible with Article 24 of the Spanish Constitution. The Constitutional Court held that breath tests were not designed to compel drivers to admit certain facts, but were merely a means of obtaining expert evidence, and could not be regarded as obliging the driver to incriminate himself or, therefore, as being contrary to Article 24 § 2 of the Constitution. The court held that breath tests did amount to interference with the right to respect for a person’s private life, guaranteed by Article 18 of the Constitution, but that the interference was necessary for the prevention of road accidents and for the safety of others. After adversarial proceedings the Saragossa Criminal Court no. 7, in a judgment of 12 January 1998, convicted the applicant of serious failure to obey orders on the ground that he had refused to submit to a breath test. It sentenced him to six months’ imprisonment. At about 6.30 a.m. on 20 July 1996 the applicant struck two other cars while attempting to park in Saragossa. An argument ensued with the owners of the other two cars and the applicant was taken to the police station where he was ordered to submit to a breath test. The applicant refused to do so, despite being informed that his refusal might make him liable to prosecution for serious failure to obey an officer’s orders. In a judgment of 2 June 1997 the Saragossa Criminal Court no. 1 decided to refer to the Constitutional Court the question whether Article 380 of the Criminal Code, which made serious failure to obey orders a criminal offence, was compatible with Article 24 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right not to make self-incriminating statements and not to confess guilt. The court accordingly decided to stay its decision on the charge until the Constitutional Court had ruled on the constitutionality of Article 380. Following the above-mentioned judgment of the Constitutional Court of 18 December 1997, the Saragossa Criminal Court no. 1, in a judgment of 5 January 1998, convicted the applicant of serious failure to obey an officer’s orders on the ground that he had refused to submit to a breath test. It sentenced him to six months’ imprisonment. The applicant appealed to the Saragossa Audiencia provincial. The case is still pending before that court. “Anyone driving a motor vehicle or moped under the influence of toxic or narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances or alcoholic drinks shall be liable to a prison sentence of eight to twelve weekends or to three to eight month-fines and shall in any event be disqualified from driving a motor vehicle or moped … for a period of one to four years.” “A driver who refuses to comply with a law-enforcement officer’s orders to submit to a statutory test to verify the condition referred to in the preceding Article shall be punished in the same way as a person convicted of serious failure to obey orders, as provided in Article 556 of this Code.” “Anyone … who resists an order of the authorities or their officers, or is guilty of serious failure to obey them in the exercise of their duties, shall be liable to a prison sentence of six months to one year.” Under section 12(2) of the Traffic and Road Safety Act of 2 March 1990 and sections 21 to 24 of the General Implementing Regulations of 17 January 1992, tests of alcohol levels may be ordered by a police officer or a judicial authority. They usually consist in testing, by means of approved breath-testing device, the air exhaled. The person concerned can ask for a second test, which may be a blood, urine or other test.",0,968
323,323,"The applicant is a British national, born in 1957 and he is currently in prison in Kent, the United Kingdom. He is In or around 1996 the applicant was charged with conspiring to contravene section 20 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, contrary to section 1(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1977. The particulars of the offence were that between 1 January 1991 and 8 May 1996 the applicant conspired with others to assist in the commission in the Netherlands of an offence punishable under the law of the Netherlands and corresponding to the law of the United Kingdom, namely, the manufacture of methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (“Ecstasy”). The applicant was alleged to have played a role in arranging for the purchase of the constituent chemicals used in the production of Ecstasy from Russia for transportation to the Netherlands or Belgium where the Ecstasy would be produced. Much of the evidence against the applicant and his co-conspirators came from a British under-cover police officer who had infiltrated the organisation in a joint British and Dutch operation. The trial of four of the applicant’s co-conspirators began in the Netherlands in November 1996. They had been charged with a number of offences relating to the same conspiracy including charges relating to the manufacture of Ecstasy. The prosecutor requested a custodial sentence of 6 years (which took account of the time spent in pre-trial detention) for WF, who was alleged to be a main player in the conspiracy. However, the Dutch court declared one of the principal charges against WF relating to the manufacture of Ecstasy inadmissible in so far as it related to acts committed outside the Netherlands and decided that that charge was otherwise not proven against him. Between December 1996 and 26 February 1997 these co-conspirators were convicted on the other charges which were not directly related to Ecstasy production. WF was found guilty of having been concerned in the importation of cannabis, of possession of firearms and ammunition, of possession of Ecstasy pills and of having being concerned in the supply of cocaine and amphetamines, and he was sentenced to 40 months’ imprisonment. The second accused was found guilty of offences almost identical to WF and he was sentenced to 30 months’ imprisonment. The third accused was found guilty of having been concerned in the importation of cannabis, of handling two stolen watches, of having been in possession of a pistol and of having been concerned in the supply of cocaine and amphetamines, and he was sentenced to 24 months’ imprisonment. The fourth accused was found guilty of having been concerned in the importation of cannabis and he was sentenced to 24 months’ imprisonment (6 months of it being suspended). In April 1997 the applicant pleaded guilty in the Crown Court in the United Kingdom to the above-described charge against him. He pleaded not guilty to 4 other related charges and these were not proceeded with. In September 1997 he was sentenced to nine and a half years’ imprisonment. The maximum sentence was 14 years’ imprisonment and he received a credit of one third in the light of his guilty plea. Submissions as to the lower sentences received by his co-conspirators in the Netherlands were rejected during his sentencing hearing. Senior Counsel’s advice dated 11 October 1997 suggested requesting leave to appeal from a single judge of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) on the basis that the appeal court would benefit from arguments addressing the terms of Recommendation No. R(92)17 concerning sentencing policy and the effect of that recommendation on the case of Gavin Lillie ([1995] 16 Cr. App. R (S) 534), which prohibited an English court from considering as relevant sentences imposed in other jurisdictions. The applicant applied to a single judge of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) for leave to appeal against sentence to that court, arguing that the sentence imposed was excessive in that it was manifestly disproportionate to that imposed on his co-conspirators in the Netherlands. On 30 December 1997 the single judge rejected the leave request, finding that there was no basis in English law upon which he could grant leave. He pointed out that the above-cited case of Gavin Lillie was binding upon him and that, in English sentencing terms, the sentence passed was unexceptional, the contrary not having been suggested by the applicant. He also found that a sentence suggested by a Dutch prosecutor would not provide any basis to challenge what was otherwise an appropriate sentence imposed by an English court.",0,750

His claim for widows’ benefits was made in March 2001 and on 2 May 2001 it was determined that he was entitled to Widowed Parent’s Allowance as from 10 April 2001. The applicant however requested that the claim be treated as from the date of his wife’s death, or alternatively that he be allowed to claim the equivalent widow’s benefit. On 22 October he made a formal application for widow’s benefit which was rejected on 27 February 2002 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows’ benefits because he was not a woman. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law. 7.

On 23 March 2006 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) dismissed his complaint on the ground that since the date of entry into force of the 2004 Act no undue delays in the proceedings could be discerned, the proceedings having been conducted with due diligence and within a reasonable time. The court observed that the 2004 Act had entered into force on 17 September 2004 and could not be applied to the proceedings before that date. 14. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court’s decisions in the cases of Charzyński v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), §§ 12-23, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v.

The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. The applicant was the first president of the Republic of Azerbaijan since it gained independence in 1991. He was elected by popular vote on 8 September 1991 and remained in office until 15 May 1992. Thereafter, the applicant left Azerbaijan and settled in Moscow. At present, a criminal case is pending against the applicant before the Azerbaijani authorities. The government of Azerbaijan had asked the relevant Russian authorities to extradite the applicant to Azerbaijan, but this request was rejected. The applicant remains active in Azerbaijani politics and is a co-chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Azerbaijan. Before the presidential elections of 15 October 2003, a number of the applicant’s political supporters in Azerbaijan formed a “voters initiative group” that decided to nominate the applicant as a presidential candidate for the upcoming elections. To this effect, on 16 July 2003 they filed an application with the Central Election Commission (the “Commission”). On 21 July 2003 the Commission rejected this application for failure to comply with the election laws and refused to register the applicant as a presidential candidate. No further explanations were given in the Commission’s formal decision. Thereafter, the voters’ initiative group filed a suit in the Court of Appeal, requesting to quash the Commission’s decision as unlawful. On 24 July 2003 the Court of Appeal rejected this request. Upon an appeal in cassation, on 7 August 2003 the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision.",0,286

On 29 August 2005 the proceedings, which had taken place before the courts of three levels of jurisdiction, were completed by a final ruling of the Supreme Court allowing the applicant’s claim in part. 7. In the course of the proceedings, there was one remittal of the case from the appellate court to the first-instance court for fresh consideration. The courts also ordered seven forensic technical expert examinations. 8. There were several adjournments in the proceedings due to the parties’ failure to appear for hearings.",1,110
333,333,"4. The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Rab. 5. On 10 June 1996 a company J. (“the company”) instituted civil proceedings against the applicant in the Rijeka Commercial Court (Trgovački sud u Rijeci) seeking restitution of business premises in the applicant's possession and payment of rent. 6. On 7 August 1996 the applicant filed a counterclaim against the company seeking payment of a certain amount of money on the basis of his investments in the business premises. 7. The two cases were joined. 8. On 2 October 1996 the Rijeka Commercial Court decided in the company's favour. At the same time it dismissed the applicant's claim as inadmissible because the company had meanwhile gone bankrupt and the applicant failed to report his claim in bankruptcy. 9. The applicant appealed against that decision. On 11 February 1997 the High Commercial Court (Visoki trgovački sud Republike Hrvatske) upheld the first instance judgment. 10. On 27 March 1997 the applicant filed a request for revision on points of law (revizija) with the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske). 11. On 11 December 2001 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant's request on its merits. That decision was not served on the applicant until 6 May 2002. 12. Meanwhile, on 22 March 2002 a new section 59 (a), which subsequently became section 63 of the Constitutional Court Act entered into force, introducing a domestic remedy for length of proceedings in form of a constitutional complaint. 13. In line with the new legislation, on 11 April 2002 the applicant filed a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) complaining about the length of the proceedings. 14. On 2 October 2002 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant's complaint because the Supreme Court had meanwhile decided his case. 15. Article 29 of the Constitution guarantees, inter alia, the right to a court which shall decide on an individual's rights and obligations within a reasonable time. 16. The relevant part of section 62 of the Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court (Ustavni zakon o Ustavnom sudu Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette no. 49/2002, of 3 May 2002; “the Constitutional Court Act”) reads as follows: “1. Everyone may lodge a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court if he or she deems that the individual act of a state body, a body of local and regional self-government, or a legal person with public authority, which decided about his or her rights and obligations, or about suspicion or accusation for a criminal act, has violated his or her human rights or fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution, or his or her right to local and regional self-government guaranteed by the Constitution (hereinafter: constitutional right)... 2. If another legal remedy is allowed against the violation of the constitutional rights [complained of], the constitutional complaint may be lodged only after this remedy has been exhausted. 3. In matters in which an administrative action or, in civil and non-contentious proceedings, a revision on points of law are allowed, remedies are exhausted only after the decision on these legal remedies has been given.” 17. The relevant part of section 63 of the Constitutional Court Act reads as follows: “1. The Constitutional Court shall examine a constitutional complaint whether or not all legal remedies have been exhausted if the court with jurisdiction fails to decide a claim concerning the applicant's rights and obligations or a criminal charge against him or her within a reasonable time ... 2. If a constitutional complaint ... under paragraph 1 of this section is upheld, the Constitutional Court shall set a time-limit within which the court with jurisdiction must decide the case on the merits... 3. In a decision issued under paragraph 2 of this section, the Constitutional Court shall assess appropriate compensation for the applicant for the violation of his or her constitutional rights ... The compensation shall be paid out of the State budget within three months from the date a request for payment is lodged.” The relevant part of the Civil Procedure Act (Zakon o parničnom postupku, Official Gazette nos. 53/91, 91/92, 58/93, 112/99, 88/01) in the relevant part reads as follows: Section 382 provides that a request for revision on points of law may be filed against the second instance judgment within 30 days following its service on the party. It also enumerates cases in which such a request is allowed. Sections 395 and 396 provide that the Supreme Court, in case it finds a request for revision on points of law well-founded, may quash the second instance judgment and remit the case or, in certain cases, it may also reverse the second instance judgment.",1,772
334,334,"The applicant, Ms Aminat Nasirkhayeva, is a Russian national who lives in Grozny, Chechnya. She is represented before the Court by Mr D. Itslayev, a lawyer practising in Nazran, Ingushetia. The respondent Government are represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights. The applicant had four children. One of them, Ms Balizha Nasirkhayeva, was born in 1992. The applicant lived in Grozny with her family. In 1999 the Russian Government launched a counter-terrorist operation in Chechnya. On 27 December 1999 the applicant’s daughter received a wound to the head as a result of an explosion. The family and the wounded child remained in the basement of their house in view of the ongoing hostilities. On 11 or 13 January 2000 when federal servicemen reached the district, they gave Balizha Nasirkhayeva first aid and delivered the applicant and her daughter to a military hospital by helicopter. From there the applicant and her daughter were taken to a hospital in Vladikavkaz where the child spent six days in an intensive care unit. On 7 April 2000 Balizha Nasirkhayeva was brought to the Clinical Hospital of Ingushetia in Nazran and diagnosed with a post-traumatic condition caused by a penetrating wound to the skull. She was operated upon and several days later she was transferred by plane to a specialised paediatric hospital, the Ninth Hospital, in Moscow. On 14 April 2000 Balizha Nasirkhayeva died at the intensive care unit of the Ninth Hospital in Moscow. On 23 September 2004 the applicant and her husband sought assistance in receiving compensation for their child’s death from the Human Rights Office of the President of the Chechen Republic (“the Human Rights Office”). On 25 July 2005 the applicant sued the Government of Chechnya, seeking compensation for her daughter’s death. On 16 May 2006 the Staropromyslovskiy District Court of Grozny awarded her 20,000 Russian roubles in a lump sum, such award being given to people whose relatives had died during the counter-terrorist operation in Chechnya. The remaining claims for non-pecuniary damage were dismissed for the absence of a causal link between the actions of the defendant and the claim. The applicant did not appeal and on 26 May 2006 the judgment became final. On 24 October 2005 the Human Rights Office requested that the prosecutor’s office of the Zavodskoy District of Grozny (“the district prosecutor’s office”) investigate Balizha Nasirkhayeva’s death. The letter indicated that information about the criminal proceedings had been sought by the Staropromyslovskiy District Court within the scope of the compensation proceedings. It is unclear if this letter reached the district prosecutor’s office. On 7 March 2006 the applicant complained about her daughter’s death to the district prosecutor’s office. On 12 March 2006, referring to a letter from the Human Rights Office of 10 March 2006, the district prosecutor’s office opened an investigation under Article 105 § 1 of the Criminal Code (murder). The case was assigned number 51040. Pursuant to the Court’s request following the communication of the present case, the Government submitted thirty-six pages of documents from the criminal investigation file. These documents can be summarised as follows. On 8 April 2006 the district prosecutor’s office granted victim status to the applicant. She was questioned and stated that her daughter had been wounded as a result of an explosion. Two neighbours stated that they had heard the explosions outside and then saw that the applicant and her daughter had been wounded. The investigator also collected medical records and attempted to obtain information about the military operations in Grozny at that time. It does not appear that they obtained any relevant information in this respect. On 12 May 2006 the investigation in case no. 51040 was suspended for its failure to identify any suspects. The applicant was informed, but did not appeal against this decision. On 9 April 2009 the applicant wrote to the Investigative Committee of the Chechnya Prosecutor’s Office and asked for an update on the investigation. Article 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides as follows: “Article 125. Judicial examination of complaints 1. Decisions of an investigator or prosecutor concerning their refusal to initiate a criminal investigation ... or any other decisions and acts or omissions which are liable to infringe the constitutional rights and freedoms of the parties to criminal proceedings or to impede citizens’ access to justice, may be appealed against to a district court, which is empowered to examine the lawfulness and grounds of the impugned decisions.... 3. The court shall examine the lawfulness and the grounds for the impugned decisions or acts ... within five days from the receipt of the complaint... 5. As a result of the examination of the complaint the court shall deliver one of the following decisions: 1) Declaring the decisions, acts or omissions of the official as unlawful or unsubstantiated and obliging the official to eliminate the defects; 2) Not allowing the applicant’s complaint...”",0,821
335,335,"4. The applicants were born in 1955, 1935 and 1950 respectively and live in Hatay. 5. On various dates, the applicants bought plots of land (nos. 1233, 1230 and 1162 respectively) near the coast in Hatay. They each built a house there. 6. In 1995 the Treasury filed an action before the Samandağ Court of First Instance, requesting the annulment of the applicants’ title deeds to the land on the ground that they were located within the coastline. 7. On 16 December 1999 (nos. 40/02 and 41/02) and 9 December 1999 (42/02), the Samandağ Court of First Instance, relying, particularly, on expert reports, upheld the request of the Treasury and annulled the title deeds of the applicants to the plots of land. In its decisions, the court held that, pursuant to domestic law, coasts could not be subject to private ownership and that, therefore, the applicants could not rely on the argument that they had acted bona fides or on the fact that they had constructed buildings on the site. 8. On various dates the applicants appealed. In their petitions they submitted, inter alia, that the right to property - a human rights norm - was protected under the constitution and the domestic law, and that the domestic courts had deprived them of their property rights without proper examination and without a payment of compensation. On 3 October 2000 their appeals were dismissed by the Court of Cassation. 9. On various dates the applicants requested the Court of Cassation to rectify its decision. The Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants’ requests on 2 May 2001 (nos. 40/02 and 42/02) and 19 April 2001 (no. 41/02). These decisions were served on the applicants on 6 June 2001 (nos. 40/02 and 42/02) and 23 May 2001 (no. 41/02). 10. The relevant domestic law and practice in force at the material time are outlined in the Doğrusöz and Aslan v. Turkey judgment (no. 1262/02, § 16, 30 May 2006).",1,326
342,342,"The applicants, Mr Süphan Çintosun and Mr Şeyhmus Çintosun, are Turkish nationals who were born in 1960 and 1936 respectively and live in Diyarbakır. They are represented before the Court by Mr M. Vefa and Mr B. Deyar, lawyers practising in Diyarbakır. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. Until September 1993, the applicants lived in Kayabaşı hamlet of Dağcılar village in Silvan, Diyarbakır, where they own property. Following an armed clash between the security forces and the PKK militants in a nearby area, the security forces came to Kayabaşı and required the inhabitants to establish a village guards system – a security system designed to protect villages against possible terrorist attacks by the PKK. Upon their refusal, the security forces evacuated the hamlet. The applicants had to move to the city centre of Diyarbakır, where they currently live. On an unspecified date, the security forces set fire to the houses and the cultivated fields in the hamlet. Following the incidents, the applicants filed applications with the administrative and military authorities, asking for an authorisation to return to their hamlet, or in the alternative, to continue to cultivate their fields. They also requested to be remedied for the incidents. The applicants maintained that they were unable to provide copies of the complaints and requests they had filed but stated that the authorities had either disregarded or rejected them. The investigation carried out by the authorities indicated that the applicants had left their villages of their own will. The security forces had not destroyed the applicants’ village or forced them to leave their homes. The official records indicated that there was no obstacle preventing villagers from returning to their homes and possessions in their villages. Persons who had left their villages as a result of terrorism had already started returning and regaining their activities in their villages. On 14 July 2004 the Law on Compensation for Losses resulting from Terrorism and the Fight against Terrorism was passed by the Grand National Assembly and entered into force on 27 July 2004 (“Compensation Law”). That Law provided for a sufficient remedy capable of redressing the Convention grievances of persons who were denied access to their possessions in their villages. In that connection Damage Assessment and Compensation Commissions were set up in seventy-six provinces. Persons who had suffered damage as a result of terrorism or of measures taken by the authorities to combat terrorism could lodge an application with the relevant compensation commission claiming compensation. The number of persons applying to these commissions had already attained approximately 170,000. A further 800 persons, whose applications were pending before the Court, had also applied to the compensation commissions. Many villagers had already been awarded compensation for the damage they had sustained. A description of the relevant domestic law can be found in the Court’s decision of İçyer v. Turkey (no. 18888/02, §§ 44-54, 12 January 2006) and in its judgment of Doğan and Others v. Turkey (nos. 88038811/02, 8813/02 and 8815-8819/02, §§ 31-35, ECHR 2004-VI)",0,507
343,343,"The applicant, the late Sigvard Bernadotte, was a Swedish national, born in 1907 and was living in Stockholm. Following his death on 5 February 2002, his widow, Marianne, declared that she wished to pursue the application on his behalf. He is represented before the Court by Mrs Muhlenbock, a lawyer practising in Stockholm. The Government are represented by Mrs Eva Jagander of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, as Agent. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant was son of the late Swedish King Gustav VI Adolf. By descent he was born a prince. On 8 March 1934 the applicant, without the consent of the King, entered into marriage with a woman who was not of royal descent. For this reason, on 9 March 1934, the applicant’s father, the then Crown Prince Regent Gustav Adolf, decided on the King’s behalf: “By entering into marriage without the King’s consent and with the daughter of a foreign private person, His Majesty, The Duke of Uppland, in accordance with Article 44 of the Instrument of Government and Article 5 of the Order of Succession, has forfeited his own, his children’s and his successors’ right of succession to the throne. Moreover, he has forfeited the titles and the privileges, which until now he has enjoyed in his capacity as a hereditary prince”. The members of the Government cabinet expressed their agreement with the above decision and agreed with the King’s decision that “Sigvard Oscar Fredrik for the future may use the family name Bernadotte”. It has ever since been the understanding of the Swedish Kings that the applicant thereby lost his right to the title of prince and he has been treated accordingly in the Official Yearbooks of State Officials and Nobility respectively. Since 1976 the applicant, in several petitions to the present King of Sweden, King Carl XVI Gustav, requested that his hereditary prince title be reaffirmed by the King. The applicant supplied some information about exchanges from 1997 and 1998 between his lawyer at the time and the Marshall of the Realm (riksmarskalken). This included an extract from a letter of 15 May 1997 from the Marshall stating that “the King had not found grounds for revising the interpretations and application of his predecessor’s decision in the matter. Thus, the Royal Court considers that it had finalised its examination of the case”. The most recent petition to the King, dated 1 December 2000, was rejected on 19 December 2000. The Marshall of the Realm referred to earlier exchanges in the course of which it had been stated that the King was not prepared to carry out a revision or amendment to his predecessor’s decision in the matter. In so far as the King and the Royal Court were concerned, no changes would be made in respect of applicable titles. Under Swedish law, these refusals cannot form the subject of an appeal. According to the applicant, he suffered various inconveniences as a result of the removal of his prince title and the subsequent refusals to restore his title. At the material time (1934), Article 44 of the 1809 Instrument of Government read as follows. ""No prince of the Royal House, be he crown prince, hereditary prince or prince, may marry without the King’s knowledge and consent. In the event that this should occur, he has forfeited his hereditary right to the realm for his own part, that of his children and descendants."" A similar provision was contained in section 5 of the 1810 Act of Succession, which provided that the same applied if a prince, with or without the knowledge and consent of the King, married a commoner (“a private man’s daughter”) of Swedish or foreign origin. Following a reform in 1937, section 5 was amended to require the King to hear the Government cabinet before consenting to the marriage of a prince. At the same time, the reference to a commoner of foreign origin was abolished, while that to a commoner of Swedish origin was retained. According to the respondent Government, the reason was that, after the First World War, the number of ruling sovereigns and royal houses and other families of equal status had been reduced. According to information supplied by the Government, the main features of the domestic law pertaining to the acquisition and loss of a name remained unchanged throughout the relevant period. In 1963 the legal provisions concerning names were brought together in one statute, the 1963 Names Act (namnlagen), later replaced by the 1982 Names Act. Under these rules, surnames were acquired at birth and could be lost only in limited circumstances, for example if it were established in paternity proceedings that a certain man was not the father of a person carrying his surname or where the person concerned was not entitled to acquire the surname in the first place or had acquired a surname that caused inconvenience to another person on account of a risk of confusion. The right to carry a first name that had been registered or approved could not be revoked. Although there was no definition of the concept of name under Swedish law, it was considered that designations other than names fell outside that concept, as they were not deemed to constitute means of personal identification. This was the case of terms that indicated a profession - for example teacher, lawyer or military, or occupational position - such as professor, judge or commander, and likewise indications of rank or title, such as assistant professor, district court judge or captain. Such designations were not afforded the legal protection applicable to names. There was no domestic legal provision regulating the use of the titles of prince and princess nor any legal protection of those titles.",0,961
358,358,"4. The applicants were born in 1928 and 1933 respectively and live in Bihać. 5. Prior to the dissolution of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (“the SFRY”) the applicants deposited foreign currency in their bank accounts at the Privredna banka Sarajevo Glavna filijala Bihać. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as in other successor States of the former SFRY, such savings are commonly referred to as “old” foreign-currency savings (for the relevant background information see Jeličić v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), no. 41183/02, ECHR 2005-...). 6. Following several unsuccessful attempts to withdraw their funds, the applicants initiated court proceedings seeking the recovery of their entire “old” foreign-currency savings and accrued interest. 7. By a decision of the Bihać Municipal Court of 3 December 1993, the Privredna banka Sarajevo Glavna filijala Bihać was ordered to pay the applicants 54,469.42 German marks (DEM), 19,257.25 Swiss francs, 81.12 French francs, 60,120.49 Austrian shillings, 185.61 Canadian dollars, 231.86 US dollars, 163.39 Dutch guilders and 22,217.60 Italian liras, default interest on the above amounts at the rate applicable to overnight deposits from private individuals from 1 January 1992 and legal costs in the amount of DEM 1,940. The judgment entered into force on 12 June 1994. 8. On 9 April 1997 the Bihać Municipal Court issued a writ of execution (rješenje o izvršenju). The execution proceedings were effectively stayed between 12 January 1998 and 12 September 2001. 9. Meanwhile, on 28 November 1997, the judgment debt became a public debt pursuant to the Settlement of Claims Against the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Act 1997. 10. On 6 April 2005 the Human Rights Commission within the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Human Rights Commission”) found a violation of Article 6 of the Convention and of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention arising from a failure to enforce the judgment of 3 December 1993. It ordered the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to ensure full enforcement of the judgment in issue within two months, to pay the equivalent of 255 euros in respect of non-pecuniary damage within three months and to pay default interest after the expiry of the above time-limits at the annual rate of 10%. 11. On 28 October 2005 the applicants received the compensation awarded by the Human Rights Commission. 12. The judgment of 3 December 1993 was fully enforced on 5 June 2007 (the applicants were paid the principal debt, default interest and legal costs in the amounts specified in the judgment). 13. For relevant law and practice see the admissibility decision in Jeličić, cited above; Suljagić v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), no. 27912/02, 20 June 2006; the judgment in Jeličić v.

Schorm, Ministry of Justice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant occupied a flat in a building owned by the Ministry of the Interior. On 18 July 1996 the Ministry filed an action against the applicant seeking to order him to vacate the flat. On 16 February, 27 April and 7 September 1998 the Prague 6 District Court (obvodní soud) held three hearings. After having held a hearing on 26 May 1999, the court adopted a judgment by which it allowed the Ministry’s claim and ordered the applicant to vacate the flat. On 17 September 1999 the Prague Municipal Court (městský soud), upon the applicant’s appeal of 12 July 1999, upheld the first instance judgment. The proceedings were finally closed on 16 November 1999. On that date, the execution title became final. On 3 December 1999 the applicant filed an appeal on points of law (dovolání) in the Supreme Court (Nejvyšší soud) which dismissed it in judgment of 19 December 2000 which was notified to the applicant’s lawyer on 19 March 2001.

They were represented before the Court by Mr A. Friederich, a lawyer practising in Strasbourg. , may be summarised as follows. The applicants are orphans whose fathers died while serving in the German armed forces during the Second World War as “malgré nous”. The term “malgré nous” describes the 130,000 or so male adults from Alsace and Lorraine who were forcibly conscripted into the German armed forces from 1942 onwards; some 40,000 of them died. To prevent these conscripts from deserting, members of their extended family were occasionally taken hostage. Some members of the families of “malgré nous” who had deserted the German armed forces were subjected to forced labour or sent to concentration camps as reprisals. The Federal Republic of Germany as successor to the German Reich and the French Republic agreed on substantial compensation payments. On 15 July 1960 the Federal Republic of Germany paid 400 million German marks to the French Republic to indemnify French nationals who had been direct victims of Nazi persecution. On the basis of the Franco-German treaty of 31 March 1981, the Federal Republic of Germany made available 250 million marks to the “Fondation Entente Franco-Allemande”, a foundation established under French law, which is responsible, inter alia, for distributing compensation payments to those who were forcibly conscripted; the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic agreed that with these payments the “malgré nous” had been compensated. Orphans of deceased “malgré nous” were not eligible for compensation. One applicant lodged a petition with the German Bundestag. On 20 September 2007 the Bundestag decided to discontinue the examination of the petition on the grounds that the German and French governments had agreed that the payments in 1960 and 1981 had been the final gesture (abschließende Geste) towards the former French soldiers who had been forcibly conscripted into the German armed forces.",0,331

On an unspecified date in April 1998 he lodged an action against a collective farm B., seeking damages for a discrepancy in the calculation of compensation for his professional illness that had been paid since 1982. On 9 April 1998 the Makariv District Court (“the District Court”) opened proceedings. 6. In a judgment of 28 December 1998 it dismissed the applicant's action. On 6 April 1999 the Kyiv Regional Court of Appeal (“the Court of Appeal”) quashed that judgment and ordered a fresh hearing. 7. On 20 April 2000 the District Court ordered an accounting expert examination. It held the next hearing on 2 June 2003. 8. On 4 July 2003 the Makariv Department of State Insurance Fund for Industrial Accidents and Diseases (“the Fund”) joined the proceedings as a second respondent and B. was replaced by its legal successor, private company L. 9. On 21 October 2003 the District Court dismissed the applicant's claim for damages that after a modification amounted to UAH 16,018 (EUR 2,563). On 9 January 2004 the Court of Appeal upheld that judgment. On 9 February 2004 the applicant appealed in cassation. 10. On 17 May 2006 the Supreme Court rejected his appeal in cassation. 11. According to the Government, in the course of the proceedings, the applicant filed one procedural request and three appeals, one of which did not meet procedural requirements. Out of the sixteen hearings scheduled between April 1998 and May 2006, six were adjourned for unknown reasons, two were adjourned either at the applicant's request or due to his failure to attend, one was adjourned due to one of the respondents' failure to attend, one was adjourned for the parties to reach a friendly settlement, and two were adjourned for other reasons beyond parties' control.",1,306

In February 1995 the applicant brought an action for recovery against a company T before the Tampere District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätt). On 5 May 1995 the District Court partly rejected and partly accepted the applicant’s claims. Both the applicant and the company T appealed to the Turku Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovrätt). The applicant also submitted a new piece of evidence. After the time for appeal had expired, the applicant filed another submission requesting an oral hearing. The company T had requested a hearing in its appeal. On 3 May 1996 the Court of Appeal, in written proceedings, reversed the District Court’s decision and dismissed the applicant’s action. Under Chapter 25, Section 14, Subsection 2, of the Code of Judicial Procedure (oikeudenkäymiskaari, rättegångsbalk On 16 October 1996 the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen) refused the applicant leave to appeal. B. Relevant domestic law The relevant domestic law as in force at the relevant time may be summarised as follows: Under Chapter 25, Section 14, Subsection 2, of the Code of Judicial Procedure, no new evidence, which had not been submitted to the District Court, was allowed before the Court of Appeal, unless the appellant could prove that he had been unable to submit the evidence before the District Court or that he had had a valid reason for not doing so. According to Chapter 26, Section 7, Subsection 1, of the Code of Judicial Procedure, a Court of Appeal could hold, when necessary, an oral hearing, where parties, witnesses and experts could be heard, and other evidence could be taken.",0,288
377,377,"7. The applicant was born in 1942 and lives in the United Kingdom. 8. The applicant claimed that until 14 August 1974 he and his family used to live in Morphou (Cyprus) in a detached house with a yard (area: 229 sq. m). This property was registered in the name of the applicant’s wife under plot no. 315, sheet/plan 19/32.5.2. On 14 August 1974, as the Turkish forces were advancing, the applicant and his family fled their home leaving behind all its contents, including precious personal belongings. 9. The applicant also claimed that he was the owner of the following plots of land in northern Cyprus: (a) Nicosia/Kapouti, plot no. 576, sheet/plan 19/16, field, area: 5,017 sq. m; (b) Kyrenia/Livera, plot no. 39/1, sheet/plan 5/62W1, field, area: 112,149 sq. m; (c) Kyrenia/Livera, plot no. 14, sheet/plan 5/62W2, field, area: 171,549 sq. m; (d) Kyrenia/Livera, plot no. 34, sheet/plan 5/63W1, field, area: 22,074 sq. m; (e) Kyrenia/Livera, plot no. 45, sheet/plan 5/63W1, field, area: 11,582 sq. m. 10. In support of his claim of ownership the applicant produced the relevant certificates of registration and affirmations of ownership issued by the Republic of Cyprus. 11. The applicant alleged that from 14 August 1974 onwards he had not been able to return to his house and had been continuously prevented from exercising his property rights and enjoying his properties.",1,226

The first applicant, Christina Papaioannou, is the mother of the other seven applicants, Ioannis Papaioannou, Demetris Papaioannou, Eftihia Hadjinicolaou (née Papaioannou), Neophytos Papaioannou, Stavros Papaioannou, Panayiotis Papaioannou and Andreas Papaioannou. They are all Cypriot nationals of Greek-Cypriot origin born in 1929, 1949, 1951, 1952, 1957, 1962 and 1966 respectively. Applicants nos. 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 are living in Deryneia and applicants nos. 4, 5 and 8 are living in Nicosia. They are represented before the Court by Mr A. Demetriades and Ms E.Nathanael, lawyers practising in Nicosia. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows. The applicants are owners and/or part owners of seven plots of land and three houses all situated in the area of Famagusta. Five of the plots of land were used for agricultural purposes and according to the applicants the produce from these plots was the main source of their family income. The three houses were situated on the remaining two plots of land. One of the houses was rented out whilst the other two were the homes of the applicants. In July 1974, the applicants were forced to abandon their homes and property in Famagusta. They have not had access and/ or use of them ever since.",0,217
383,383,"5. The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Lublin. 6. By a judgment of 19 November 2003 the Lublin Regional Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against a second-instance administrative decision of 25 March 2003 by which the second-instance authority had refused to acknowledge that the applicant’s ailment was of an occupational character. 7. This judgment was served on the applicant on 27 January 2004. 8. On 27 February 2004 the applicant requested to be granted legal aid. 9. On an unspecified date the Lublin Bar Association refused to assign a lawyer to the case. Subsequently, on 26 March 2004 it allowed the applicant’s request after the Supreme Administrative Court had instructed it that it had no right to refuse. 10. On 19 November 2004 the lawyer assigned to the case had effective access to the case-file. On 1 December 2004 the lawyer lodged a cassation appeal together with a request for retrospective leave to appeal out of time with the Lublin Administrative Court. 11. By a decision of 1 April 2005 that court rejected the cassation appeal. It noted that the seven-day time-limit for lodging a request for leave to appeal out of time had started, at the latest and if counted in a manner most advantageous to the applicant, on the day when the legal-aid lawyer had had an opportunity to have effective access to the case file. In the present case that time-limit had started to run on 19 November 2004, while the request had been lodged with the court on 1 December 2004. It had therefore to be rejected for failure to comply with the time-limit. 12. The lawyer appealed. On 1 April 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the contested decision and shared the legal view expressed by the regional court. 13. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the procedure for lodging cassation appeals with the Supreme Administrative Court against judgments of the Regional Administrative Courts are stated in the Court’s judgment in the case of Subicka v. Poland, no. 29342/06, §§ 1221, 14 September 2010. 14. In particular, in its decision no. II FZ 651/07 of 18 January 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court held that a request for leave to appeal out of time was the only method by which a cassation appeal submitted after the expiry of the time-limit by a legally-aided applicant could be admitted for examination. 15. When legal aid has been granted and the time-limit for the submission of a cassation appeal has already expired, it is open to the legallyaided party to submit the appeal together with a request for leave to appeal out of time made under sections 86 and 87 of the Law on the Procedure before Administrative Courts (e.g. NSA FZ 754/04 of 31 January 2005 and NSA, I OZ 160/08 of 14 March 2008). In certain cases the courts stated that such a request should be submitted within seven days from the date on which the lawyer obtained a power of attorney from the party, which date is considered as the date on which the impediment to lodging an appeal ceased to exist (e.g. the Białystok Regional Administrative Court, II SAB Bk 27/07 of 10 April 2008), or from the date when the lawyer could obtain effective access to the case file (e.g. the Poznań Regional Administrative Court, IV SA/Po 865/06 of 13 November 2007). 16. In a number of its recent decisions the Supreme Administrative Court acknowledged the difficulties which legally-aided parties experienced in connection with lodging their cassation appeals against judgments of the first-instance administrative courts. It expressed the view that they should not be penalised for the fact that their requests for legal aid were not processed speedily enough. It analysed relevant caselaw of the administrative courts and noted that the manner in which the beginning of the time-limit for lodging cassation appeals was determined had led to divergent results. It held that it was necessary to determine the relevant time in a manner compatible with effective access to the highest administrative court and which ensured equal treatment for parties represented by lawyers appointed under the legalaid scheme and by privately hired lawyers. The court held that the time-limit for a legally-aided party started to run only on the day when a legal-aid lawyer had a genuine possibility of lodging the cassation appeal and not when he or she was informed of having been assigned to the case. The court was of the view that the latter approach was far too rigorous and rendered the effective enjoyment of legal assistance granted under the legal-aid system illusory. In any event, the cassation appeal had to be lodged within thirty days from the day on which the party was informed of the appointment of the legalaid lawyer (I FZ 569/06 of 8 December 2006; I FZ 667/06 of 15 January 2007; I FZ 30/09 of 2 March 2007; II FZ 177/08 of 25 June 2008; II OZ 513/08 of 27 May 2008; I OZ 376/08 of 13 June 2008; I FZ 30/09 of 2 March 2009; II OZ 1093/09 of 9 December 2009; I FZ 30/09 of 2 March 2009).",0,859
388,388,"The applicant, Mr Muharrem Yılmaz, is a Turkish national, born in 1920 and living in İstanbul. He is represented before the Court by Mr Koçak, a lawyer practising in İstanbul. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. In 1992, the General Directorate of National Roads and Highways (Devlet Karayolları Genel Müdürlüğü), a state body responsible, inter alia, for motorway construction, expropriated a plot of land belonging to the applicant in İstanbul. A committee of experts assessed the value of the plot of land and this amount was paid to the applicant when the expropriation took place. On 25 November 1997, following the applicant’s request for increased compensation, the Pendik Civil Court of General Jurisdiction awarded him an additional compensation of 6,734,461,850 Turkish liras (TRL) plus an interest at the statutory rate of 30 % per annum. On 10 March 1998 the Court of Cassation upheld the decision of the first-instance court. The due amount, which was 11,416,404,000 Turkish liras (TRL) including the interest, was paid to the applicant on 26 May 1998. Under Law no. 3095 of 4 December 1984 the rate of interest on overdue State debts was set at 30% per annum. As of 1 January 1998 the statutory rate of interest increased to 50%. The statutory rate of interest was set at the compound interest rate, namely 60% as of 1 January 2000. A description of further relevant domestic law may be found in the Aka v. Turkey, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VI, §§ 17-25; Akkuş v. Turkey, judgment of 9 July 1997, Reports 1997-IV, §§ 13-16.",0,274
391,391,"The applicant, Mrs Natela Davitashvili, is a Georgian national who was born in 1947 and lives in Tbilisi. The respondent Government were represented by their Agent, Mr Mikheil Kekenadze of the Ministry of Justice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant had worked, under a contract of indefinite duration, as a laboratory assistant in a tuberculosis hospital since 1994. By an order of 12 July 2002, the hospital administration (“the respondent”) dismissed her. The applicant sued for unlawful dismissal and, in a judgment of 29 November 2002, the Didube-Chughureti District Court in Tbilisi found in her favour. Enforcing the terms of the above judgment, the respondent issued, on 29 November 2002, an order reinstating the applicant to her previous position. On 1 December 2002 the respondent offered, and the applicant accepted, an employment contract for six months. On 1 April 2003 the respondent notified the applicant that her contract would expire on 1 June 2003 and that no extension was possible. On 27 June 2003 the applicant filed another action, requesting, inter alia, that the respondent be ordered to re-employ her. She claimed that she had signed the six-month contract by mistake. On 18 June 2004 the Tbilisi Regional Court, overturning a lower instance decision, found for the applicant, ordering the respondent to offer her a contract of indefinite duration, as the situation had stood prior to her unlawful dismissal of 12 July 2002. The appellate judgment noted, in its operative part, that a cassation appeal lay within a month following delivery of its motivated copy to the parties. On 24 September 2004 the respondent lodged a cassation appeal. On 26 January 2005 the Supreme Court allowed the respondent’s cassation appeal, by quashing the appellate judgment of 18 June 2004 and dismissing the applicant’s employment action of 27 June 2003. The cassation court established that the Didube-Chughureti District Court’s binding decision of 29 November 2002 had been properly enforced, in so far as the respondent had duly issued, on 29 November 2002, an order reinstating the applicant to her permanent position. It was only subsequent to that reinstatement that the respondent had offered her an employment contract for six months, which she had accepted herself. The Supreme Court noted in that regard that the Labour Code did not preclude employers and employees from replacing a permanent labour relation with that of a definite duration. Nor did the labour legislation impose upon employers an obligation to extend contracts of limited duration against their will. Throughout the second set of proceedings, a labour union of which the applicant was a member submitted to the domestic courts legal arguments on her behalf. Pursuant to Article 264 §§ 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (“the CCP”), if a cassation appeal had not been lodged within the statutory period, the appellate judgment became binding. Subsequent to Article 397 § 1 of the CCP, the period for lodging a cassation appeal, which could not be either restored or extended, was one month. That period started to run from the moment of delivery of the appellate judgment to a party in question. Delivery was made either by handing a copy of the appellate judgment or its communication by registered post to a party. Article 397 § 2 of the CCP further stated that, if the appellate court had orally pronounced the reasoned text of its judgment in the presence of a party concerned, the period for lodging a cassation appeal started to run upon pronouncement.",0,591
394,394,"The applicant, Ms Irina Ščiukina, is a Lithuanian national who was born in 1958 and lives in Klaipėda. She was represented before the Court by Mr L. Zubanovas, a lawyer practising in Klaipėda. The Lithuanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms E. Baltutytė. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 19 April 1999 the applicant’s dog, a pit-bull terrier, attacked an 11 year old child, severely biting and injuring him. The prosecution instituted criminal proceedings under Article 115 of the Criminal Code (causing medium bodily harm by negligence), which were subsequently discontinued, as no evidence of a crime was disclosed. Nevertheless, in its decision of 15 July 1999, the police found the applicant guilty of an administrative offence. The decision stated that the applicant’s dog had bitten the child, and thus the applicant was liable under Article 110 § 2 of the Code of Administrative Offences (a breach of the pet-keeping rules, causing an injury). She was fined LTL 300 (about EUR 90). The applicant did not dispute that decision, and paid the fine. On 15 November 2000 the prosecution re-opened the criminal proceedings against the applicant. On 22 November 2000 a fresh medical expert examination confirmed the seriousness of the injuries caused to the boy, finding that he would need plastic surgery. On 14 December 2000 the applicant was charged with causing medium bodily harm by negligence (Article 115 of the Criminal Code) and remanded on bail, with a written obligation not to leave her place of residence. The applicant did not appeal against this restriction. On 19 March 2001 the Klaipėda City District Court acquitted the applicant. It was established that the applicant was not guilty of a criminal offence but rather of an administrative violation for which she had already been punished. On 29 May 2001 the Klaipėda Regional Court reversed this judgment, finding the applicant guilty. The appellate court noted the gravity of the injuries sustained by the boy (bite wounds on his nose, forehead, cheeks, arm and leg). The court also found that the applicant’s behaviour had been negligent, in that she had walked her dog without a muzzle, although the animal was of a dangerous breed. In view of these factors, the court concluded that the applicant’s acts must attract criminal rather than administrative responsibility. The applicant was sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment, but the sentence was rescinded by virtue of an amnesty act. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal. On 13 November 2001 the Supreme Court upheld the applicant’s conviction. It established that the applicant had been criminally liable for having caused medium bodily harm by negligence. The Supreme Court noted that in cases where the same acts attracted both criminal and administrative liability, the nature of the offence was a criterion determining which procedure ought to be applied. In particular, if the nature of the act made it punishable under the criminal law, the person should be held liable under criminal law. If the nature of the offence was not such as to attract criminal liability, a person would be held liable under the administrative law. The Supreme Court went on to say: “It was established that the applicant had caused medium bodily harm by negligence, therefore, she has been rightly convicted under Article 115 of the Criminal Code. The fact that [the applicant] has been punished for the same acts by way of an administrative procedure is not a valid ground to discontinue the criminal proceedings, since such a ground is not foreseen by the Code of Criminal Procedure. However, a person cannot be punished twice for the same offence, because it is contrary to Article 31 § 5 of the Constitution and Article 3 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Since [the applicant] has been reasonably convicted under Article 115 of the Criminal Code, the issue of the lawfulness of the administrative decision to fine [the applicant] can be reconsidered in accordance with the [Code of Administrative Offences].” Article 31 of the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania states as follows: “...Punishment may be imposed or applied on the grounds established by law. No one may be punished for the same criminal offence twice. ...” Article 3 of the Criminal Code (as then in force) stipulated: “A person shall be held liable only when the act committed is forbidden by a criminal statute which came into force before the commission of the offence ... No one shall be punished for the same criminal act twice ...” The then Article 115 of the Criminal Code provided for criminal liability for causing serious or medium bodily harm by negligence. Article 110 of the Code of Administrative Offences (as then in force) provided: “Any person who breaches pet-keeping rules - approved by the Municipal Council - shall be punished by a warning or fine of up to 100 litai. The same act, committed repeatedly or when causing damage to the health or property of others - shall be punished by a fine between 100 to 3,000 litai.” The then Article 291 of the Code of Administrative Offences provided for a right of appeal against a decision to impose an administrative penalty. The then Article 301 of that Code stipulated:  “Where a decision finding a person liable for an administrative offence has been quashed, the [fine] paid shall be reimbursed ... and other restrictions relating to the [administrative penalty] shall be repealed.”",0,912
396,396,"The applicant, Mr Milenko Toth, is a Croatian citizen who was born in 1962 and is presently serving a sentence in Lepoglava State Prison. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 15 September 1992 the competent investigating judge opened an investigation against the applicant on a charge of murder. The applicant was indicted by the Sisak County State Attorney’s Office (Okružno državno odvjetništvo Sisak) on 12 February 1993. On 27 January 1994 the investigating judge opened another investigation against the applicant, charging him with the attempted murder of a judge. He was indicted on 15 November 1994. The two criminal proceedings were subsequently joined. On 20 September 1995 the Sisak County Court (Županijski sud u Sisku) convicted the applicant of both offences. On 22 May 1996 the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) upheld the first-instance conviction with regard to the murder charge. This part of the judgment became final. At the same time, the Supreme Court quashed part of the judgment relating to the attempted murder and remitted the case. In the resumed proceedings, on 9 May 1997 the Sisak County Court convicted the applicant of attempted murder and sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment. On appeal, the Supreme Court upheld the first instance judgment on 24 June 1998. The applicant states that he filed a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court on 29 November 1999, alleging that both his convictions had been based on evidence obtained illegally and thus his right to a fair trial had been violated. His constitutional complaint concerned both convictions. He maintains that his complaint was never adjudged by the Constitutional Court. The Government admit that the applicant’s letter to the Constitutional Court dated 29 November 1999 was titled “a constitutional complaint”. However, they submit that the applicant had already lodged a constitutional complaint on 25 February 1999 and that his letter of 29 November 1999 was merely an extension of his previous complaint, seeking to include the proceedings concerning the murder, which had ended in 1996. It was thus regarded by the Constitutional Court as a new submission in an already existing case. Moreover, the Government submit two decisions of the Constitutional Court, by which it adjudged the entirety of the complaints raised by the applicant in his submission dated 29 November 1999 with regard to both proceedings. In its decision dated 4 October 2000, the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint, finding no violation of his right to a fair trial in the proceedings concerning the attempted murder. In its decision dated 8 March 2002 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint relating to the fairness of the proceedings concerning the murder, as it had been lodged outside the statutory time-limit.",0,458
400,400,"6. The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Chişinău. 7. In July 1994 the applicant concluded a contract with ASITO (a private insurance company incorporated in Moldova) whereby she paid an insurance premium in exchange for a fixed annuity of 500 Moldovan lei (MDL) (the equivalent of 122.55 United States dollars (USD) at the time) in addition to her pension (“annuity”). She started receiving her annuity in August 1996. In January 1999 ASITO stopped paying it, invoking a change in the interest rate of the National Bank of Moldova. 8. On 4 March 1999 the applicant brought an action against ASITO, seeking the payment of the annuity to date and requiring the company to abide by the contract. 9. On 21 June 1999 the Râşcani District Court ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered ASITO to pay her the pension arrears in the amount of MDL 3,421.50 (the equivalent of 282.32 euros (EUR) at the time). ASITO lodged an appeal with the Chişinău Regional Court, which dismissed it on 25 April 2000. ASITO did not appeal and the judgment became final and enforceable. 10. On 29 May 2000 the applicant lodged a request with the Râşcani District Court seeking enforcement of the judgment in her favour. The latter did not reply, but sent the enforcement warrant to a Bailiff only on 17 May 2002. 11. In the meantime, since in its judgment of 21 June 1999 the Râşcani District Court had ruled only on the payment of the pension arrears, on 24 November 2000 it issued an additional judgment in favour of the applicant and ordered ASITO to abide by the contract and to resume the monthly payments. That judgment became final. 12. Between 2000 and 2002 the applicant lodged other complaints about the non-enforcement of the judgments in her favour with the Râşcani District Court, the Bailiff, the Ministry of Justice and the Superior Council of Magistrates. On 8 May 2002 the Ministry of Justice requested the Râşcani District Court to take all necessary steps, including the sanctioning of the persons responsible, in order to enforce the judgments in favour of the applicant and to inform her about the outcome of the enforcement proceedings. The applicant did not receive any further reply; nor were any sanctions imposed on the debtor company or its employees. 13. The final judgment of 25 April 2000 and the additional judgment of 24 November 2000 were enforced on 5 September 2003. 14. The relevant domestic law was set out in Prodan v.

On an unspecified date the Zavodsky District Court of Zaporizhzhya (“the District Court”) gave an unspecified decision on the claim of the applicant’s former husband, Z., lodged against the applicant for division of their property. By a final ruling of 5 February 1985, the Zaporizhzhya Regional Court (“the Regional Court”, since June 2001, the Zaporizhzhya Regional Court of Appeal), ordered Z. to compensate the applicant for her share of their property. 6. In 1985 the Prosecutor’s Office of Zaporizhzhya and the Zavodsky District Police Department invited the applicant to discuss the residence registration of her daughter, O. 7. In 1988-1989 the applicant lodged claims with the Budenovsky District Court of Donetsk and Donetsk Regional Court seeking division of her common property with Z. There is no indication whether and, if so, how these claims were handled by the courts. 8. In 1991-2005 the applicant unsuccessfully tried to have her brothers, K.Vi. and K.Vo., prosecuted for hooliganism and theft. She was not found to be a civil party to these proceedings. 9. On 9 November 1992 K.Vi. and K.Vo. lodged a claim against the applicant challenging the validity of their mother’s will over a house and belongings. 10. On 25 September 1998 the District Court partly allowed the claim. 11. Following a “protest” of the Zaporizhzhya Regional Prosecutor of 25 September 1998, the Regional Court quashed this judgment on 25 December 1998 and remitted the case to the Distrcit Court which, on19 February 2004 partly allowed the applicant’s claim. 12. On 26 May 2004 the Regional Court upheld this judgment. On 22 June the applicant appealed in cassation. On 12 July 2006 she requested the Supreme Court to speed up examination of her case. By a final ruling of 4 October 2006, notified to the applicant on 19 October, the Supreme Court upheld the lower court’s decisions. 13. According to the Government, between 11 September 1997 and 4 October 2006, the applicant filed three procedural requests and two appeals which all met procedural requirements. Moreover, of the twenty nine hearings scheduled, eleven were adjourned at the claimants’ request, five were adjourned at the applicant’s request, four were adjourned due to the claimants’ or witness’s failure to attend, one was adjourned due to the applicant’s failure to attend, one was adjourned at the parties’ request, and three were adjourned for reasons beyond the parties’ control. Overall, due to the applicant’s requests or her failure to attend, the proceedings were delayed for about eleven moths.",1,424

They are represented before the Court by Mr Hüseyin Aygün and Mr Özgür Ulaş Kaplan, lawyers practising in Tunceli. The facts of the cases, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. Until 1994 the applicants lived in Yakatarla, Şahverdi and Akören villages, in the districts of Ovacık and Hozat, in Tunceli province, where they own property. In 1994, security forces forcibly evacuated Yakatarla, Şahverdi and Akören on account of disturbances in the region. They also destroyed the applicants’ property. The applicants and their families then moved to Tunceli, Mersin and Bursa where they currently live. On 14 and 17 May 2002 the representatives of the applicants filed petitions, on behalf of the applicants, with the offices of the Tunceli Governor and the Hozat District Governor requesting permission to return to their villages and compensation for the damage they had suffered. On 7 June 2002 the State Emergency Department of the Governor’s office in Tunceli sent the following reply to the applicants’ representatives: “... The Şahverdi, Yakatarla and Akören villages are being considered under the ‘Return to the Village and Rehabilitation Project’. Thus, the residents of those villages can reside in Hanuşağı, Arslandoğmuş, Burnak, Kızık, Koyungölü, Söğütlü, Topuzlu, Ziyaret, Mollaaliler, Çakmaklı, Cevizlidere, Gözeler, Güneykonak, Havuzlu, Konaklar and Yoncalı villages in Ovacık district or Sarısaltık, Çaytaşı, Karaca, Tavuklar, Karabakır, Geçimli, İnköy, Beşelma, Dalören, Akpınar, Yenidoğdu, Kavuktepe and Türktaner villages in Hozat district. ... Your petition containing requests of permission to return to village will be considered under the ‘Return to Village and Rehabilitation Project’.” On 11 September 2002 the representative of the applicants lodged a petition with the Public Prosecutor’s office in Tunceli complaining about the dereliction of duty by the Tunceli Governor and the Hozat and Ovacık District Governors (görevi ihmal). On 18 September 2002 the Tunceli Public Prosecutor issued a decision of non-jurisdiction and sent the case-file to the Public Prosecutor’s office at the Court of Cassation. On 30 September 2002 the Public Prosecutor’s office at the Court of Cassation decided not to start the proceedings into the allegation of dereliction of duty against the Tunceli Governor (dilekçenin işleme konulmaması). On 23 June 2003 the Tunceli Administrative Council decided not to conduct an investigation into the applicants’ allegations of dereliction of duty against the Hozat and Ovacık District Governors. On 7 July 2003 the representatives filed an objection with the Malatya Regional Administrative Court against the decision of the Tunceli Administrative Council. On 2 October 2003 the Malatya Regional Administrative Court rejected the objection. On 30 October 2003 the Tunceli Public Prosecutor decided not to conduct investigation into the applicants’ allegations against the Hozat and Ovacık District Governors. On 20 November 2003 the representative of the applicants filed an objection with the Elazığ Assize Court against the decision of the Tunceli Public Prosecutor. On 4 December 2003 the Elazığ Assize Court rejected the objection. The investigation carried out by the authorities indicated that the applicants had left their villages of their own will. The security forces had not forced the applicants to leave their village. The official records indicated that there was no obstacle preventing villagers from returning to their homes and possessions in their villages. Persons who had left their villages as a result of terrorism had already started returning and regaining their activities in their villages. On 14 July 2004 the Law on Compensation for Losses resulting from Terrorism and the Fight against Terrorism was passed by the Grand National Assembly and entered into force on 27 July 2004 (“Compensation Law”). That Law provided for a sufficient remedy capable of redressing the Convention grievances of persons who were denied access to their possessions in their villages. In that connection Damage Assessment and Compensation Commissions were set up in seventy-six provinces. Persons who had suffered damage as a result of terrorism or of measures taken by the authorities to combat terrorism could lodge an application with the relevant compensation commission claiming compensation. The number of persons applying to these commissions had already attained approximately 170,000. A further 800 persons, whose applications were pending before the Court, had also applied to the compensation commissions. Many villagers had already been awarded compensation for the damage they had sustained. A description of the relevant domestic law can be found in the Court’s decision of İçyer v. Turkey (no. 18888/02, §§ 44-54, 12 January 2006) and in its judgment of Doğan and Others v. Turkey (nos. 88038811/02, 8813/02 and 8815-8819/02, §§ 31-35, ECHR 2004-VI).",0,762

The second applicant, Mr Milan Konček, is the first applicant’s brother who was born in 1951 and lives in Košice. The third applicant, Mrs Jolana Končeková, was their mother. She was born in 1921, lived in Rybník pri Ratkovej and died on 26 February 2006. The Slovak Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs M. Pirošíková. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 14 June 2001 the applicants filed an action with the Rimavská Sobota District Court claiming a sum of money. On 1 October 2001 the applicants specified their action. On 6 February 2002 the District Court delivered a payment order. On 25 February 2002 the defendant company filed an objection to the order. The order ceased to have effect. The District Court scheduled hearings for 17 April and 6 May 2002. On 5 and 29 April 2002 the applicants requested that the hearings be cancelled and that their representative be heard, for reasons of procedural economy, by a court in Košice. On 25 June 2003 the applicants’ representative was heard by a different court in accordance with the applicants’ above proposal. On 7 July 2003 the case file was returned to the Rimavská Sobota District Court. On 12 November 2003 the District Court dismissed the action. On 30 December 2003 the Banská Bystrica Regional Court quashed the first-instance judgment. The applicants challenged the length of the proceedings before the Rimavská Sobota District Court by way of a constitutional complaint. On 20 May 2004 the Constitutional Court found that the applicants’ right under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention to a hearing within a reasonable time had not been violated. It held that there had been a single period of inactivity between 7 July and 12 November 2003 which did not justify the conclusion that the length of the proceedings was excessive. It noted that the applicants by their unspecific action had contributed to the overall length of the proceedings. On 19 July 2004 the District Court rejected the action. The decision was quashed by the court of appeal on 29 September 2004. On 29 September 2005 the case was assigned to another judge. On 26 February and 28 October 2008 the District Court dismissed the action and the judgments were quashed by the court of appeal on 19 August 2008 and 25 February 2009, respectively. The proceedings are pending.",0,423
410,410,"5. The applicant is a limited partnership under liquidation, with its seat in Pécs. 6. In 1996 the Tax Authority established that the applicant owed some 10 million Hungarian forints (HUF) in outstanding taxes. To secure this claim, on 10 April 1997 it attached a 100%-share the applicant had in another company, which was nominally worth over HUF 103 million. Aware of the applicant’s own intention to sell the share by 30 June 1997, the Tax Authority forbade the transaction but did not proceed to auctioning it within the statutory two-month deadline or afterwards. 7. In the ensuing two-year-long administrative procedure, the applicant’s tax debt was eventually cancelled and the asset unfrozen. However, by that time the company in which the share belonged had been liquidated – as of July 1997 – and the share had lost its value altogether. 8. Some time in 1999 the applicant sued the Tax Authority for damages. On 12 December 2000 the Baranya County Regional Court awarded it HUF 103 million. On 13 June 2002 the Supreme Court quashed this decision. On 3 June 2003 the Regional Court again found for the plaintiff. 9. On appeal, on 6 May 2004 the Pécs Court of Appeal reversed this judgment and rejected the applicant’s action. It held in essence that there had been no causal link between the Tax Authority’s unlawful omission to hold an auction to sell the attached asset within two months from its attachment, as required by section 116(1) of the Enforcement Act 1994, and the damage the plaintiff had sustained. In the court’s view, the burden of proof to show that had there been a timely auction the share could have successfully been sold to a buyer with the requisite liquidity lay with the applicant. However, the applicant could not prove this assertion. The court observed that the buyer suggested by the applicant had never had, according to its books, the capital needed for the acquisition; that the company in which the share belonged had lost all its own capital by early 1997 and been in liquidation as of July 1997; and that its manager had been convicted of fraudulent bankruptcy. 10. On 16 March 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s petition for review. This decision was served on 22 April 2005. The applicant’s request for a re-opening was to no avail.",1,391
413,413,"4. The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in the town of Kremenchug, Ukraine. 5. At the material time the applicant worked as an accountant at the Cherkasytransgas State company. 6. In May 1998 the authorities revealed a shortfall of 70,000 Ukrainian hryvnyas (UAH) in the Cherkasytransgas accounts. On 30 November 1998 the local police instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant for embezzlement of State funds. On 20 January 1999 criminal proceedings for forgery and negligence were also instituted. 7. On 26 January 1999 criminal proceedings against M. were instituted in connection with the same episode of embezzlement. On 1 April 1999 criminal proceedings against the applicant and M. were joined. 8. On 21 September 1999 the applicant gave a written undertaking not to abscond. 9. The criminal proceedings against M. were terminated on 22 October 1999. 10. On 1 December 1999 the applicant's case was sent to the court. 11. On 18 April 2000 the Kremenchug Court found the applicant guilty of embezzlement of State funds and sentenced her to ten years' imprisonment. The court also ordered confiscation of any property belonging to the applicant. 12. On the same day the applicant was imprisoned. 13. On 7 June 2000 the Poltava Regional Court (since June 2001 the Poltava Regional Court of Appeal) quashed this judgment and remitted the case for additional investigation. 14. On 15 August 2000 the applicant was released. 15. In the course of the investigation several expert reports on handwriting, accountancy and technical criminal questions were submitted. 16. By 11 January 2001 the additional investigation was completed and the case was transferred to the court. 17. On 3 December 2003 the Kremenchug Court found the applicant guilty of embezzlement and sentenced her to five years' imprisonment. The court also disqualified the applicant from holding positions of financial responsibility for three years and ordered confiscation of any property belonging to her. 18. On 12 March 2004 the Poltava Regional Court of Appeal reduced the applicant's sentence to three years and six months' imprisonment. 19. On 11 November 2004 the Supreme Court of Ukraine lifted the three year disqualification from holding positions of financial responsibility and upheld the remainder of the decisions of 3 December 2003 and 12 March 2004. 20. Subsequently the applicant requested the Supreme Court of Ukraine to review the case under the extraordinary review procedure but to no avail.",1,396
417,417,"The applicant, Mr Oleksandr Borysovych Omelchuk, is a Ukrainian national who was born in 1977 and lives in Kozyatyn. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 6 May 2004 the applicant participated in a hearing before the Zhytomyr Regional Court of Appeal (“the Regional Court”) as a legal representative. The judge dealing with the case found him to be in contempt of court. The applicant, in turn, approached the police officers in charge of keeping order on the court’s premises and told them that the judge had committed a crime. A dispute followed, as a result of which the applicant was arrested for disobeying the police. Later on 6 May 2004 the applicant was taken to the Zhytomyr City Police Department, where he was allegedly placed in a cage for several hours without any food or access to toilet facilities. On 7 May 2004 the Korolyovskyy District Court of Zhytomyr (“the Korolyovskyy Court”), by a final ruling delivered following a hearing at which the applicant was present, found him guilty of disobeying police orders and sentenced him to ten days’ administrative detention. On 15 May 2004 it issued another final ruling, again doing so after a hearing at which the applicant was present, by which it found him guilty of contempt of court and sentenced him to fifteen days’ administrative detention. While waiting for the hearing on that date, the applicant was allegedly held in a cage in the court’s basement without food. On 11 April 2006 the Supreme Court quashed both rulings of the Korolyovskyy Court under the extraordinary review procedure sought by the applicant and remitted the case for fresh examination. It noted, in particular, that the first-instance court had failed to duly establish the facts of the case, to indicate in a clear manner exactly what had amounted to contempt of court and disobeying police orders, to give adequate reasons for its treatment of the applicant’s arguments or to consider applying less restrictive sanctions. On 3 May 2006 the Korolyovskyy Court examined the case in the applicant’s absence and issued two final rulings, by which it terminated the administrative offence proceedings against him as time-barred. On 5 July 2004 the applicant introduced with the Bogunskyy District Court of Zhytomyr (“the Bogunskyy Court”) and with the Korolyovskyy Court two identical complaints against the Zhytomyr Regional Police Department, alleging, in particular, that they had subjected him to ill treatment during his arrest on 6 May 2004. On 30 September 2004 the Bogunskyy Court forwarded the complaint to the Korolyovskyy Court in accordance with the rules of territorial jurisdiction. According to the applicant, the Korolyovskyy Court handled both of his complaints separately. By a ruling of 5 October 2004 it stayed the examination of one of the complaints and invited the applicant to specify his complaint and substantiate the violations he was complaining of by 20 October 2004. As this was not done, on 21 October 2004 the court decided to deem the complaint as having not been lodged and to return it to the applicant. On 8 December 2004 the Regional Court upheld that ruling. As to the second complaint, on 28 December 2004 the Korolyovskyy Court refused to accept it for examination, having noted that it contained allegations of criminal offences and therefore had to be submitted to the prosecution authorities for criminal investigation. On 21 April 2005 and 26 July 2007 the Regional Court and the Higher Administrative Court respectively upheld that ruling. The applicant acted as the legal representative of Ms B. and Ms K. in civil proceedings. He also represented a private company, L., before the domestic tax authorities. Following a refusal by the local tax office to register the aforementioned company as a taxpayer, the applicant unsuccessfully sought the initiation of criminal proceedings against the officials involved. On 25 November 2004 the Court received the first letter from the applicant expressing his intention to introduce an application and outlining the substance of his complaints. The letter, which was dated 14 October 2004, had among its enclosures copies of certain newspapers issued on 21 October and 12 November 2004. Its envelope was postmarked 17 November 2004. The provisions of the Administrative Offences Code (“the AOC”) concerning administrative arrest as punishment for an administrative offence and the lack of an ordinary appeal procedure are summarised in the judgment in the case of Gurepka v. Ukraine, no. 61406/00, §§ 28-32, 6 September 2005. Article 267 of the AOC provided, inter alia, that an arrest on grounds of an administrative offence could be challenged by the arrestee before the supervising authority, a prosecutor or the courts. By virtue of the Amendment Act enacted on 17 November 2008, a second level of jurisdiction was introduced into the administrative offence procedure (Article 287 of the AOC).",0,818
418,418,"4. The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Kraków. 5. On 19 June 2000 the Katowice District Prosecutor issued a bill of indictment against the applicant on charges of drug trafficking, unlawful possession of firearms and membership of an organised criminal gang. There were 36 accused and 147 witnesses in the case. 6. On 20 February 2001 the Katowice District Court held a first hearing in the case. From that date to 30 March 2004 the court scheduled two hundred hearings in the case. During that period of time the court held one hundred thirty and two hearings. 7. On 13 February 2008 the Katowice District Court gave judgment in the case convicting the applicant. The applicant appealed. 8. The proceedings are currently pending before the Katowice Regional Court. 9. On 31 May 2005 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Katowice Court of Appeal under the Act of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”). He also claimed just satisfaction in the amount of PLN 10,000. 10. On 20 July 2005 the Katowice Court of Appeal dismissed the length complaint. Although the court found that the proceedings had lasted a very long time, it concluded that this had not amounted to an “excessive length” as defined by the 2004 Act. The Court of Appeal pointed out that the court had scheduled 58 hearings in 2001, 66 in 2002, 73 in 2003, 64 in 2004 and 85 in 2005. However, several hearings had had to be postponed because defence lawyers, co-accused and witnesses were absent and assessors and judges were ill. 11. On 19 October 2006 the applicant lodged another complaint with the Katowice Court of Appeal. 12. On 31 January 2007 the Katowice Court of Appeal again dismissed the length complaint. The court found that the proceedings had been handled properly and the delays had been attributable to other persons and unexpected circumstances rather than to the court. The Court of Appeal pointed out that since July 2005 the court had held over 30 hearings and over 30 hearings had had to be postponed because defence lawyers and experts had been absent, assessors, a judge and certain co-accused had been ill, renovation works had been carried out in the hearing room and there had been a shortage of police officers to convey the accused to the court. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the proceedings were of a complex character and noted that the court had taken many appropriate steps in order to speed them up. 13. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court’s decisions in the cases of Charzyński v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), §§ 12-23, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, §§ 34-46, ECHR 2005-V.",1,519
419,419,"4. The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Budapest. 5. On 28 October 1991 the applicant brought an action in the Budapest Regional Court seeking the annulment of a contract and the ownership of a real-estate. Between 13 February 1992 and 31 May 1994 the court held eight hearings and obtained the opinion of an expert. 6. On 10 November 1994 the proceedings were interrupted on account of the death of one of the respondents. The successors were not identified until 24 February 1999. The court informed the parties of this fact on 9 November 1999, and the proceedings resumed on 4 January 2000. 7. Four further hearings took place between 30 May 2000 and 9 March 2001. 8. On 8 June 2001 the Regional Court dismissed the applicant's action. 9. On 21 June 2001 the applicant appealed. Following repeated warnings from the appellate court, his appeal was only lodged in due and proper form on 3 December 2001. 10. On 11 December 2002 the Supreme Court, sitting as a second-instance court, dismissed the applicant's appeal. 11. On 7 October 2003 the Supreme Court rejected as inadmissible the applicant's petition for review, without an examination of the merits.",1,200
420,420,"5. The applicant was born in 1978 and lives in Astrakhan. 6. On 5 September 2003 the applicant gave birth to a daughter out of wedlock. 7. On 11 November 2003 she lodged a claim with the Kirovskiy District Court of Astrakhan against Mr A., with whom she allegedly had been in a relationship since 2000, in order to establish paternity and obtain child maintenance. In the course of the proceedings the applicant was represented by a counsel. 8. On 15 December 2003 the court ordered a DNA test to be carried out. The blood samples were collected in Astrakhan and sent to a specialised institute in Moscow for a forensic genetic examination. According to the expert conclusion submitted on 19 March 2004, the probability that Mr A. was the father of the applicant’s daughter was 99.99%. 9. On 2 June 2004 the court heard the defendant’s representative, who contested the admissibility of the DNA test on account of procedural shortcomings, and the applicant, who insisted on its accuracy; and rejected the applicant’s claim in full. It found that the applicant had failed to support her allegations. With respect to the expert forensic report the court found as follows: “...Blood sampling for the expert report was entrusted to the Bureau of forensic-medical examinations in the Astrakhan Region... According to the Instruction on organisation and production of expert examinations in Bureaus of forensic medical examinations, blood samples must be packed individually... An envelope must be supplied, with identifying information (on the basis of an identity document) and signatures of a medical worker who took the blood samples and two medical workers who were present during this procedure... On the envelopes with the blood samples of Mr A., Ms Kalacheva and Ms K.D. [the applicant’s daughter] there are no data based on the identity documents of the above persons. Moreover, there are only two signatures on the envelopes, one of which belongs to a person who took the blood samples... Taking into account that the blood samples were collected with serious violations of the Instruction..., the court is critical of the expert conclusion, since it cannot exclude the possibility that the blood samples received by the experts were not those collected from the parties.” 10. The court found the other evidence submitted by the applicant, namely a photo showing her with the defendant and a badge in her name, issued by the hostel (where they allegedly met), insufficient to conclude that the defendant was her child’s father. 11. The applicant and her lawyer lodged an appeal against this judgment, claiming that the case should be sent to a fresh examination due to the court’s failure to respect the civil procedural law. On 29 June 2004 the Astrakhan Regional Court upheld the judgment of 2 June 2004. It mentioned that, under civil procedural law, an expert conclusion was not binding on the court, and that in the present case the DNA test, carried out in breach of the relevant procedure, was not corroborated by other evidence. 12. On 20 June 2005 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation rejected an application for supervisory review lodged by the applicant’s lawyer. 13. Under Article 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Russian Federation (“CCP”, in force as of 1 February 2003), rights and interests of minors are protected in court proceedings by their legal representatives – parents, adoptive parents or tutors. Under Article 49 of the Family Code of the Russian Federation of 29 December 1995 (Семейный кодекс РФ, in force as of 1 March 1996), if a child is born to parents who are not married to each other and there is no joint declaration or declaration by the child’s father, the paternity of the child shall be established in court proceedings on the application of either parent, or tutor, or a child in question upon reaching a full age. In such proceedings the court shall have regard to any evidence that establishes the child’s paternity with certainty. 14. Article 67 of the CCP provides that a court shall evaluate evidence in confidence, based upon a comprehensive, detailed and impartial review of all the evidence of the case. No evidence has a predetermined value. 15. An expert conclusion is not binding upon the court, and shall be evaluated by the court according to the rules stated in Article 67 of this Code. If the court disagrees with the expert conclusion, it shall explain its reasons in its decision (Article 86 § 3 of CCP). In case of doubt as to the accuracy or reasonableness of the expert conclusion, a court may order a second expert opinion to be prepared by other experts (Article 87 § 2 of CCP). 16. Resolution no. 9 of the Plenary Supreme Court of the Russian Federation of 25 October 1996 on application by the courts of the Family Code of the Russian Federation to cases concerning paternity and maintenance provides that in order to establish paternity the court may, if necessary, order a forensic examination. Under Article 86 § 3 of the CCP, the experts’ conclusion regarding a child’s descent, including a DNA test, is evidence that must be weighed together with other evidence (Article 6).",1,869
423,423,"5. The applicants were born in 1966 and 1972 respectively and live in Istanbul. Mr Saygılı (“the first applicant”) is the owner of a daily newspaper, Günlük Evrensel, and Mr Bilgiç (“the second applicant”) is its editor-in-chief. Until 22 July 2001 the first applicant owned another daily newspaper named Yeni Evrensel. 6. On 23 November 2000 the First Chamber of the Istanbul State Security Court convicted Mr Bülent Falakaoğlu, the editor-in-chief of Yeni Evrensel, of the offence defined in Article 312 § 2 of the Penal Code for certain articles published therein. The conviction entailed certain measures being taken against Yeni Evrensel. Pursuant to Additional Article 2 § 1 of the Press Act (law no. 5680) then in force, the court ordered the newspaper to cease publication for a period of one month. 7. On 18 June 2001, while the closure order was yet to be executed, the applicants notified the office of the Istanbul Governor of their intention to publish a new newspaper, named Günlük Evrensel. 8. On 22 July 2001 Mr Saygılı ceased Yeni Evrensel's publication. The following day he launched Günlük Evrensel with a new editor-in-chief, Mr Bilgiç, and a new team of columnists. 9. On 8 September 2001 a number of police officers came to the applicants' printing headquarters to execute the closure order. They found that the applicants had discontinued Yeni Evrensel and started to publish Günlük Evrensel. The officers informed the public prosecutor in Zeytinburnu who, in return, concluded that Günlük Evrensel was Yeni Evrensel's successor. 10. On 13 September 2001 the public prosecutor applied to the Zeytinburnu Magistrates' Court (Sulh Ceza Mahkemesi) for a seizure warrant. The court issued the warrant authorising the seizure of Günlük Evrensel's two recent issues. 11. The same day the applicants filed an objection with the higher criminal court, the Zeytinburnu Criminal Court of First Instance (Asliye Ceza Mahkemesi), asserting that Günlük Evrensel was not Yeni Evrensel's successor. Unconvinced by the applicants' assertions, the court rejected the application without giving any reasons, other than stating that “it was established that Günlük Evrensel was Yeni Evrensel's successor”. 12. For the following 29 days the same sequence of events took place; the prosecutor requested a seizure warrant for the latest issue, the Magistrates' Court granted it and the applicants unsuccessfully lodged a number of objections against those decisions with the Zeytinburnu Court, which repeated its above conclusion in each of its decisions. In their objections the applicants drew the Zeytinburnu Court's attention to the fact that as Günlük Evrensel had first been published on 23 July 2001 and Yeni Evrensel was not officially closed down until 8 September 2001, it could not possibly be Yeni Evrensel's successor. Moreover, Günlük Evrensel had a different editorial team than that of Yeni Evrensel. The applicants also argued that the seizure of Günlük Evrensel was in breach of Articles 6 and 10 of the Convention because, inter alia, the seizure decisions were not adequately reasoned. 13. On 25 September 2001 the applicants wrote to the Ministry of Justice and requested that a written order be issued against the seizure orders. They repeated their arguments under Articles 6 and 10 of the Convention. 14. Meanwhile, the Zeytinburnu prosecutor filed a number of criminal charges against the applicants on the ground that they had breached the shutdown order by issuing a successor newspaper. The charges were joined and examined by the Zeytinburnu Criminal Court of First Instance. On 26 December 2001 the court acquitted the applicants as it found that the two newspapers in question were unrelated. The court also revoked the seizure warrants, which had already been executed by then. 15. Additional Article 2 of the Press Act: “Where offences [prescribed in Article 312 § 2 of the Penal Code] ... and those threatening national security and general morals are committed via the press, the relevant publication may be ordered to be shut down by the competent court for a period of three days to one month. Any publication which manifestly succeeds a previous publication that was so ordered ... shall be seized by a warrant to be issued by a magistrates' court.”",1,688

The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant’s wife died on 7 October 1997. In December 2000, the applicant made a claim for widows’ benefits. On 7 December 2001 the applicant was informed that his claim had been disallowed as he was not a woman. On an unspecified date the applicant applied for reconsideration. On 2 February 2002 reconsideration took place and the previous decision was upheld. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefit was payable to widowers under United Kingdom law. The domestic law relevant to this application is set out in Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, §§ 40-41, 25 July 2007.",0,186
426,426,"The applicant, Cârmuirea Spirituală a Musulmanilor din Republica Moldova, is an organisation of Muslims from the Republic of Moldova. They were represented before the Court by Mr S. Ostaf, a lawyer practising in Chişinău. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. On 25 July 2000 several natural persons joined together to form the applicant organisation – Cârmuirea Spirituală a Musulmanilor din Republica Moldova – an organisation of Muslims with the goal of having the Muslim religion officially registered in Moldova and building a Mosque in the city of Chişinău. On the same date the organisation adopted its articles of association. Pursuant to the Religious Denominations Act (see below), which requires religious denominations active in Moldovan territory to be recognised by means of a government decision, the applicant organisation applied for recognition on 6 September 2000. On 18 September 2000 the Government replied that they needed more time in order to examine and observe the activity of the organisation. On 25 October 2000 the applicant organisation lodged a new request with the Government. On 29 November 2000 the applicant organisation brought an action against the Government seeking an order to oblige the Government to reply to their request and to register their religion. On 12 February 2001 the Court of Appeal obliged the Government to give an answer to the applicant's request. It did not oblige the Government to register their religion. The applicant organisation appealed against this judgment. On 30 May 2001 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the applicant's appeal, quashed the judgment of 12 February 2001 and sent the case for re-examination to the Court of Appeal in a different formation of judges. On 8 October 2001 the Court of Appeal decided that it could not oblige the Government to register the Muslim religion because the applicants had not submitted to the Government all the documents provided for in Articles 14 and 15 of the Religious Denominations Act (see below). The applicant appealed against this judgment. On 24 April 2002 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the judgment of the Court of Appeal, confirming that the applicant organisation had failed to submit to the Government a document setting out the fundamental principles of their religion. The Supreme Court also noted that the Government had informed the applicant organisation on several occasions that the documentation it had provided was incomplete, but the applicant failed to remedy this. The relevant provisions of the Religious Denominations Act (Law no. 979-XII of 24 March 1992) in force at the material time read as follows: Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right must be manifested in a spirit of tolerance and mutual respect and it includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance. Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. ... No one can be forced to practice or not to practice the rites of a denomination... ... The confessional intolerance, manifested through acts which obstruct the freedom of a denomination recognised by the State, constitutes an offence and shall be punished in accordance with the law. ... “Denominations shall be free to organise and operate freely on condition that their practices and rites do not contravene the Constitution, the present Act or the legislation in force. Denominations that do not comply with this condition shall not qualify for State recognition. ... In order to be able to organise and operate, denominations must be recognised by means of a government decision. Where a denomination fails to comply with the conditions laid down by the first paragraph of section 9 of the present Act, recognition may be withdrawn. “To qualify for recognition, each denomination shall submit to the Government, for scrutiny and approval, the articles of association governing its organisation and operation. The articles of association must contain information on its system of organisation and administration and on the fundamental principles of its beliefs.”",0,725
433,433,"4. The applicants were born in 1946, 1957 and 1970 respectively and live in Voronezh. 5. The applicants are in receipt of welfare payments for their children. In 1999 – 2000 they brought separate sets of civil proceedings against a local welfare authority, claiming arrears in those payments. 6. On 17 December 1999 the Levoberezhny District Court of Voronezh awarded the first applicant 3,245.28 Russian roubles (RUR) against the welfare authority. This judgment entered into force on 28 December 1999. 7. On 31 January 2000 the writ of execution was issued and sent to the bailiffs. 8. On 26 July 2001 the bailiffs discontinued the enforcement proceedings in respect of the judgment of 17 December 1999 and returned the writ of execution to the first applicant, as the debtor had insufficient funds. 9. On 26 February 2002 the first applicant complained to the Department of Justice of the Voronezh Region about the bailiffs’ failure to execute the judgment in her favour. 10. By letter of 27 March 2002 the Department of Justice of the Voronezh informed the first applicant that the judgment in question had not been enforced, as the defendant had insufficient assets, and that it was open to her again to send the writ of execution to the bailiffs’ service. 11. On 29 April 2002 the first applicant lodged a court complaint against the bailiffs for their failure to enforce the judgment in her favour. 12. On 19 June 2002 the Leninskiy District Court of Voronezh allowed the first applicant’s complaint and ordered the bailiffs to recommence the enforcement proceedings. 13. On 2 June 2004 the first applicant was paid the amount due pursuant to the writ of execution. 14. On 29 March 2000 the Leninskiy District Court of Voronezh awarded the second applicant RUR 1,980.6 against the welfare authority. This judgment entered into force on 9 April 2000. 15. On 29 March 2000 the writ of execution was issued and sent to the bailiffs. 16. On 26 July 2001 the bailiffs discontinued the enforcement proceedings in respect of the judgment of 29 March 2000 and returned the writ of execution to the second applicant, referring to the lack of the debtor’s funds. 17. On 27 April and 6 May 2002 the second applicant again sent the writ of execution to the bailiffs’ service. 18. On 30 September 2002 the bailiffs returned the writ of execution to the second applicant, having stated that they had been unable to enforce the judgment in her favour, as the defendant refused to pay. 19. On 2 June 2004 the judgment of 29 March 2000 was paid in full. 20. On 9 November 2000 the Tsentralny District Court of Voronezh awarded the third applicant RUR 4,304.7. This judgment entered into force on 20 November 2000. On the same date the writ of execution was issued and sent to the bailiffs. 21. On 26 July 2001 the bailiffs discontinued the enforcement proceedings in respect of the judgment of 9 November 2000 and returned the writ of execution to the third applicant by reference to the lack of the debtor’s funds. 22. On 24 May 2002 the third applicant requested the bailiffs’ service and the Department of Justice of the Voronezh Region to ensure the enforcement of the judgment in her favour. It is unclear whether any response was ever sent to that request. 23. On 2 June 2004 the third applicant was paid the amount due pursuant to the writ of execution. 24. Section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997 provides that a bailiff’s order on the institution of enforcement proceedings must fix a time-limit for the defendant’s voluntary compliance with a writ of execution. The time-limit may not exceed five days. The bailiff must also warn the defendant that coercive action will follow, should the defendant fail to comply with the time-limit. 25. Under Section 13 of the Law, the enforcement proceedings should be completed within two months of the receipt of the writ of enforcement by the bailiff.",1,673
434,434,"4. The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Germany. 5. The applicant was a civil engineer and a partner in a company. He was also acting as an automobile commissioner in his spare time. 6. In the course of an operation carried out against the activities of an illegal organisation, namely the Islami Hareket Örgütü (the Islamic Movement Organisation), the applicant was arrested and taken into custody together with Mr A.A. while they were leaving the applicant’s house on 28 November 1995. It appears from the arrest protocol that the police officers were following Mr A.A. who was suspected of being a member of that organisation. 7. On the same day, the applicant’s house was searched. According to the search and seizure protocol drafted by the police officers and signed by the applicant and his wife, the police did not find anything illegal or incriminating. 8. Between 28 November and 11 December 1995, the applicant was interrogated and confronted with a number of suspects. The applicant claims that he was beaten and given electric shocks during this time. 9. On 11 December 1995 the applicant was examined by a doctor at the Bursa Forensic Medical Department who did not find any signs of illtreatment on the applicant’s body. The report mentioned that the applicant complained of a bruise on his left eye and of having been given electric shocks. 10. On the same day, the applicant was brought before the prosecutor when he denied the accusations against him and claimed to have given his statements in custody under duress. He was then brought before a judge at the Istanbul State Security Court who ordered his detention on remand. 11. On 27 December 1995 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicant, along with two other suspects, accusing him of providing the Islamic Movement Organisation with financial support by forging licences and plates for stolen cars and, subsequently, selling them. The prosecutor requested that the applicant be convicted and sentenced for membership of an illegal organisation under Article 168 § 2 of the Criminal Code. 12. On an unspecified date the criminal proceedings against the applicant and two other accused commenced before the Istanbul State Security Court. 13. During the proceedings the applicant refuted the accusations against him. In particular, he challenged the authenticity of the documents in the case file claiming that some of them had been replaced. In support of his argument, he claimed, inter alia, that the search and seizure protocol was torn and that therefore the police had drafted a new one and made him sign under his wife’s name. In his final observations on the merits, the applicant also stated that he had been forced to sign his statements in police custody. 14. On 9 September 1996 the applicant was released pending trial. 15. On 13 February 1998 the Istanbul State Security Court convicted the applicant of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation, under Article 169 of the Criminal Code, and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment. In its decision, the court noted, inter alia, that there was no evidence that the applicant had taken part in any armed or unarmed activity of the organisation in order to be considered a member of that organisation. However, the court was not convinced that the applicant did not know that, through his constant financial relationship with Mr A.A., he had been helping the organisation. 16. On 22 April 1998 the applicant appealed against this judgment. In his appellate petition, the applicant submitted, in particular, that the police documents relied upon by the prosecution did not reflect the truth. In this regard, he stated that the documents drafted by the police in Bursa were torn and replaced by the police in Istanbul. The applicant further claimed that he was coerced into signing the documents drafted by the police. Finally he pointed out that the police had not found a single book concerning political Islam in his house. 17. On 15 April 1999 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court in so far as it concerned the applicant and quashed the remainder of the judgment. 18. The Government informed the Court that on 9 February 2001 the Istanbul State Security Court decided to defer the sentence of the applicant pursuant to Law no. 4616 on Conditional Release, Deferral of Procedure and Punishments. 19. The relevant domestic law and practice in force at the material time are outlined in the following judgments: Özel v. Turkey (no. 42739/98, §§ 20-21, 7 November 2002) and Gençel v. Turkey (no. 53431/99, §§ 11-12, 23 October 2003). 20. By Law no. 5190 of 16 June 2004, published in the Official journal on 30 June 2004, the State Security Courts have been abolished.",1,802

447,447,"4. The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Lugansk. 5. On 8 August 2001 the Leninskyy District Court of Lugansk ordered the State Enterprise “Luganskyy Stankobudivelnyy Zavod” to pay the applicant UAH 2,575.34 in salary arrears and compensation for the delay in its payment. 6. On 13 September 2001 the Leninskyy District Bailiffs' Service of Lugansk instituted enforcement proceedings. 7. On 13 November 2002 the Bailiffs' Service informed the applicant that the decisions in his favour had not been executed due to the substantial number of enforcement proceedings against the debtor and the debtor's lack of funds. 8. On 19 April 2005 the applicant was paid the amount due to him in full. 9. In April 2002 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Leninskyy District Court of Lugansk against the same company, seeking compensation for its failure to pay him the judgment debt of 8 August 2001. 10. On 8 July 2002 the court rejected the applicant's claim as unsubstantiated. On 5 September 2002 and 28 January 2003, respectively, the Lugansk Regional Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court upheld the decision of 8 July 2002. 11. The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-18 and 39-41, 27 July 2004).",1,211
449,449,"The first applicant, Ms Knel, is the mother of the second applicant, Veira. Both applicants are resident in Rotterdam. Ms Knel had a relationship with Veira’s father out of which Veira was born on 17 December 1981. It is alleged that this relationship was terminated soon after Veira’s birth, after which Veira lived with his mother Ms Knel. At that time both applicants were resident in Surinam and had Surinam nationality. Ms Knel married another man. She and her husband moved to the Netherlands in 1985, leaving Veira with his paternal grandparents. She now has Netherlands nationality. Veira still has Surinam nationality. In 1987 Ms Knel applied to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for a provisional residence visa (machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf) in Veira’s name. Such a visa is normally a prerequisite for the grant of a residence permit which confers more permanent residence rights. By a letter dated 12 March 1987 the Visa Service of the Ministry of Justice informed the Netherlands embassy in Surinam that there was no objection to the grant of a provisional residence visa to Veira. The applicants state that they were never informed of any decision, whether favourable or otherwise. They did not, however, take proceedings on the basis of an implied refusal, as they might have done within a reasonable time if it appeared that a decision was not forthcoming. It appears that Veira remained in Surinam. A new request for a provisional residence visa was lodged in 1992, through the Netherlands embassy in the Surinam capital Paramaribo. On 25 September 1992 the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave a decision refusing such a visa on the ground that Veira, having been resident with his grandparents since 1985, had ceased to be part of his mother’s family unit. The applicants lodged an objection (bezwaarschrift) against this decision on 20 October 1992. Following a hearing on 21 January 1993 the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave a decision on 15 March 1993 dismissing the objection. This decision was transmitted to the embassy in Paramaribo. The applicants lodged an appeal with the Judicial Division (Afdeling rechtspraak) of the Council of State (Raad van State) against the Minister’s decision on 8 April 1993. This appeal was withdrawn on 21 June 1995. It is stated that their reason for so acting was that Veira could not obtain a passport from the Surinam authorities, and that without a passport they did not expect the appeal to have any prospects of success. As alleged by the applicants, the situation in Surinam had become untenable due to the deterioration of Veira’s grandparents’ health. Ms Knel decided to bring Veira into the Netherlands without complying with the formalities, and on 22 October 1993 Veira entered the Netherlands. On 13 October 1995, nearly two years after Veira had entered the Netherlands, Ms Knel applied in his name for a residence permit. By a decision dated 22 March 1996 the Deputy Minister of Justice refused to grant such a permit. On 3 June 1996 the applicants lodged an administrative appeal (administratief beroep) against the Deputy Minister’s refusal. This was rejected on 13 December 1996. The applicants appealed to the Regional Court (Arrondissementsrechtbank) of The Hague on 24 December 1996. Following a hearing on 17 June 1997 the Regional Court dismissed the appeal on 21 June 1997. The Regional Court considered that Veira could be cared for in Surinam by a sister of Veira’s father, with financial assistance from Ms Knel if need be, and that the applicant’s separation in 1985 had been a consequence of Ms Knel’s choices with regard to the way she had wished to lead her personal life. It appears from a letter received from the applicants’ representative on 17 June 1998 that the Netherlands authorities were then contemplating removing Veira to Surinam. However, the Court has not been informed that this has taken place.",0,643
453,453,"4. The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Koluszki, Poland. 5. Between 1991 and 1993 the applicant was the Head of the Civic Gasification Committee of the “Łódzkie” housing co-operative (Społeczny Komitet Gazyfikacji “Os. Łódzkie”). 6. In July 1995 the Board of the Koluszki Commune (Zarząd Miasta i Gminy) requested the prosecution service to initiate an investigation against the applicant for not returning documents concerning the Committee. 7. On 16 October 1995 the applicant was charged with having hidden the documents. 8. On 2 January 1996 the applicant was indicted before the Tomaszów Mazowiecki District Court (Sąd Rejonowy). 9. On 9 May and 13 November 1996 the District Court held hearings. On the latter date it gave a judgment in which it found that the applicant had committed the offence. The trial court conditionally discontinued the proceedings. The applicant was given a term of probation of one year and ordered to pay PLN 300 to a charity. The applicant appealed. 10. On 23 September 1997 the Piotrków Trybunalski Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) held a hearing and on 25 September 1997 it dismissed the applicant’s appeal. 11. In May 1998 the applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy). 12. On 9 January 2001 the Supreme Court dismissed the cassation appeal as manifestly ill-founded. 13. Articles 417 et seq. of the Civil Code (Kodeks cywilny) provide for the State’s liability in tort. In the version applicable until 1 September 2004, Article 417 § 1, which lays down a general rule, read as follows: “1. The State Treasury shall be liable for damage caused by a State official in the performance of the duties entrusted to him.” 14. Article 442 of the Civil Code sets out limitation periods in respect of various claims based on tort. That provision applies to situations covered by Article 417 of the Civil Code. Article 442, in so far as relevant, reads: “1. A claim for compensation for damage caused by a tort shall lapse three years following the date on which the claimant learned of the damage and of the persons liable for it. However, the claim shall in any case lapse ten years following the date on which the event causing the damage occurred.” 15. On 17 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”) entered into force. It lays down various legal means designed to counteract and/or redress the undue length of judicial proceedings. A more detailed rendition of the relevant domestic law provisions is set out in the Court’s judgment in Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, §§ 34–46, ECHR 2005–... (extracts) and in Charzyński v. Poland (dec.), no. 15212/03, §§ 12-23, ECHR 2005-....",1,479
454,454,"1. The applicant, Mr Vasile Balan, is a Moldovan national who was born in 1956 and lives in Pănăşeşti. He was represented before the Court by Mr Lilian Osoian, a lawyer practising in Chişinău. The Government were represented by their Agent, Mr Vladimir Grosu. 2. The facts of the case may be summarised as follows. 3. On 28 September 2003 the applicant was accidentally injured by an individual, D., sustaining an injury to his left thigh bone. On an unspecified date the applicant instituted civil tort proceedings against D., seeking a court order obliging D. to pay him compensation for pecuniary damage. 4. On 26 November 2004 the Străşeni District Court ordered D. to pay the applicant 7,184 Moldovan lei (MDL) (the equivalent of 435 euros (EUR) in compensation for pecuniary damage and MDL 215 (EUR 13) for legal fees. This decision was final and an enforcement warrant was issued. It has not been enforced to date. 5. On 28 July 2009 the Court delivered the Olaru and others pilot judgment (see Olaru and Others v. Moldova, nos. 476/07, 22539/05, 17911/08 and 13136/07, 28 July 2009) in which it found, inter alia, that the problem of non-enforcement of domestic judgments awarding social housing to different categories of individuals disclosed the existence of a “systemic problem”. The Court ordered, inter alia, that the respondent State set up an effective domestic remedy which secures adequate and sufficient redress for non-enforcement or delayed enforcement of final domestic judgments (see Olaru and others, cited above, § 58 and point 4 of the operative part). 6. On 20 September 2011 the Moldovan Government informed the Court that on 1 July 2011 a new law (Law no. 87) entered into force, instituting a remedy against the problem of non-enforcement of final domestic judgments and against the problem of unreasonable length of proceedings. 7. On 29 September 2011 the Registry of the Court informed the applicant and all other applicants in the same position of the new remedy, asking whether they intended to make use of it within the six-month time-limit set by Law No. 87 (see paragraph 9 below). The applicants’ attention was drawn to the fact that according to Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, the Court may only deal with a matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted and that failure to observe the above rule could constitute a reason for declaring the application inadmissible. 8. By a letter of 10 November 2011 the applicant informed the Court in response that he was not intending to use the new remedy because it was not effective. In particular, the applicant argued that even the denomination of Law no. 87 suggested that it offered a remedy only when a final judgment had not been enforced in a timely manner but not when the judgment had not been enforced at all. In the applicant’s view, the law did not provide for a mechanism to trigger a rapid enforcement of an unenforced final judgment. Moreover, the applicant submitted that it would be an excessive burden for him to be requested to go back to the domestic courts and attempt to exhaust the new remedy. 9. According to Law no. 87 anyone who considers him or herself to be a victim of a breach of the right to have a case examined or a final judgment enforced within a reasonable time is entitled to apply to a court for the acknowledgement of such a breach and compensation. According to section 1 of the law, it should be interpreted and applied in accordance with the national law, the Convention and the Court’s case-law. According to section 4 of the law the courts are obliged to deal with applications lodged under the law within three months. Section 5 of the law states that if a breach of the right to have a case examined or a final judgment enforced within a reasonable time is found by a court, compensation for pecuniary damage, non-pecuniary damage and costs and expenses have to be awarded to the applicant. Section 6 of the law simplifies the procedure of enforcement of judgments adopted under the law so as no further applications or formalities should be required from the part of the applicants. Under section 7 of the law all individuals who have complained to the European Court of Human Rights that their right to a trial within a reasonable time or to enforcement of a judgment within a reasonable time has been violated may claim compensation in domestic courts within six months of the entry into force of the new law, provided that the European Court has not ruled on the admissibility and merits of the complaint. 10. At the same time the Code of Civil Procedure was modified in such a manner as to reduce the number of instances of appeal from two to one and to waive court fees for such proceedings.",0,820
456,456,"4. The applicant was born in 1912 and lives in Novovoronezh. 5. On 19 September 2000 the Novovoronezhskiy Town Court of the Voronezh Region granted the applicant’s claim against the Novovoronezh Social Security Service and awarded her 10,300.86 Russian roubles (RUR) for pension arrears. 6. The judgment was not appealed against and entered into force. On 19 October 2000 a writ of execution was issued. 7. The judgment was executed on 2 March 2005.",1,74
457,457,"8. The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Gross-Rohrheim (Germany). 9. On 10 August 1989 the applicant registered his marriage with Ms G. in Novosibirsk. After the marriage they moved to St. Petersburg. 10. On 12 May 1995, during her stay at her parents’ home in Novosibirsk, Ms G. gave birth to a son to whom she gave her surname, despite objections from the applicant. Shortly thereafter the birth was registered; the applicant was named as the child’s father in the register. 11. In late September 1995 Ms G. and her son returned to St. Petersburg. The applicant believed that he was the boy’s father and treated him as his own. 12. On 28 March 1996 the applicant moved to Germany. Until September 1997 he waited for Ms G. and the son to join him there. However, in a letter of September 1997, Ms G. informed him that she had no plans to continue their marriage and would be applying for maintenance for the child. At about that time the applicant’s relatives in Novosibirsk advised him that he was not the boy’s father. 13. On 16 December 1997 the applicant petitioned for divorce and brought an action contesting paternity. On 12 April 1999 the divorce was granted. 14. On 16 November 2000 the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court of Novosibirsk delivered judgment in the paternity action. It noted that genetic (DNA) tests of 28 June 1999 and 5 June 2000 demonstrated that the applicant could not be the boy’s father. Although Ms G. maintained that the applicant was the father, in the absence of any doubts as to the accuracy of the tests, the court established that the applicant was not the father of her son. The District Court ruled, however, that the case was governed by the RSFSR Marriage and Family Code of 30 July 1969 because the child had been born before 1 March 1996, that is to say before the new Family Code of the Russian Federation came into effect. The RSFSR Marriage and Family Code set a one-year limitation period for an action contesting paternity, the starting point of which was calculated from the date the putative father was informed that he had been registered as the father. As the applicant had not contested paternity when the child was born and had only applied to the courts in December 1997, after the expiry of the time-limit, his action was held to be time-barred. The fact that a new Family Code had been introduced which did not lay down a limitation period for paternity actions was irrelevant because it was only applicable to family-law disputes arising after 1 March 1996. 15. On 15 March 2001, on an appeal by the applicant, the Novosibirsk Regional Court upheld the judgment of 16 November 2000. 16. On 20 April and 26 October 2001 the Novosibirsk Regional Court and the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, respectively, refused requests by the applicant for supervisory review. 17. On 12 September 2002 the Justice of the Peace of the Third Court Circuit of the Zheleznodorozhniy District of Novosibirsk granted Ms G.’s claim for maintenance and made a charging order over the applicant’s interest in a flat. 18. On 15 September 2003 the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court of Novosibirsk upheld the maintenance order. 19. The RSFSR Marriage and Family Code of 30 July 1969 (Кодекс РСФСР о браке и семье) provided that a person entered in the birth register as the father of a child could contest the entry within one year of the date he became or should have become aware that the entry had been made (Article 49). 20. The Family Code of the Russian Federation of 29 December 1995 (Семейный кодекс РФ, in force from 1 March 1996) provides that a person entered in the birth register as the father of a child may contest the entry by means of judicial proceedings (Article 52 § 1). It does not set any time-limit for bringing an action. 21. Resolution no. 9 of the Plenary Supreme Court of the Russian Federation of 25 October 1996 “On application by courts of the Family Code of the Russian Federation to the cases concerning paternity and maintenance” established that, in respect of children born before 1 March 1996, the RSFSR Marriage and Family Code was applicable and, accordingly, the time-limit for contesting paternity was one year from the date the person became or should have become aware of his registration as the child’s parent.",1,747
464,464,"The first applicant, Mr Leonid Nikolayevich Dudnik, was born in 1946. The second applicant, Mr Vladimir Rabinovich, was born in 1939. The third applicant, Mr Vladimir Dobrov, was born in 1942. All three applicants are Ukrainian nationals. The first applicant lives in Tel Aviv – Yafo, the other two live in Bat-Yam, Israel. They were represented before the Court by Mr A. L. Reyzenson, who lives in Bat Yam. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev, of the Ministry of Justice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicants had been receiving their old age pension at the time when they left Ukraine for permanent residence in Israel. Mr Rabinovich left on 23 September 1999, Mr Dobrov – on 24 December 2000 and Mr Dudnik – on 20 September 2001. Before their departures, they had been paid, upon their written requests, their pensions for six months in advance with consecutive termination of such payments in accordance with Article 92 of the Law on Pensions. In January and February 2005 the applicants wrote separate but similar complaints about the termination of their pension payments to the Constitutional Court of Ukraine. The latter forwarded them to the Pension Fund of Ukraine. By letter of 2 February 2005 to Mr Dudnik and by letters of 1 March 2005 to Messrs Rabinovich and Dobrov, the Pension Fund of Ukraine informed the applicants that the old age pensions could be paid to the citizens who resided permanently abroad only if there was a relevant international agreement with the particular State. In absence of such agreement with the State of Israel, the payment of pensions to the applicants could not be renewed. The Fund further informed that the Ministry of Labour of Ukraine was in process of drafting such an agreement. The relevant domestic law is summarised in the admissibility decision of Myroshnychenko v. Ukraine (no. 10205/04, 3 April 2007).",0,329

On 5 October 1995 the applicant filed two civil actions for damages with the Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu), one against the newspaper “Arena” and the other against the newspaper “Globus International”, claiming that these newspapers had published libellous articles about him. On 22 February 1996 and 9 June 1997 the first instance court held hearings. At the hearing on 17 October 1997 the Court heard the applicant. At the hearing on 1 October 1998 the court heard one witness. The hearing scheduled for 19 November 1998 was adjourned for 12 March 1999 when the court heard another witness and an expert. At the next hearing on 2 February 2000 the court heard yet another witness and concluded the trial. The first instance judgment, rejecting the applicant’s claim, was served on the applicant on 10 April 2000. On 24 April 2000 the applicant filed an appeal against the judgment. On 5 March 2001 the case-file was transferred to the Zagreb County Cout (Županijski sud u Zagrebu) as the appellate court. The proceedings are presently pending before the appellate court. The first instance court held a hearing on 1 April 1996. At the hearing on 17 April 1998 the defendants submitted their replies to the applicant’s claim. At the next hearing on 13 April 1999 the court heard the applicant. The hearings scheduled for 27 September 1999 and 26 November 1999 were adjourned because the witnesses summoned for these hearings did not appear. On 28 February 2000 the court heard one witness and concluded the trial. Four months later the first instance judgment, rejecting the applicant’s claim, was served on the applicant. On 6 June 2000 the applicant appealed against the first instance judgment. On 5 March 2001 the case-file was transferred to the Zagreb County Court as the appellate court. The proceedings are presently pending before the appellate court. Section 26 of the Constitutional Act on the Changes of the Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court (entered into force on 15 March 2002, published in the Official Gazette no. 29 of 22 March 2002 - hereinafter “The Act of 15 March 2002” - Ustavni zakon o izmjenama i dopunama Ustavnog zakona o Ustavnom sudu Republike Hrvatske) introduced a new Section 59 (a), which subsequently became Section 63 of the 2002 Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court. The relevant parts of that Section read as follows: (1) The Constitutional Court shall examine a constitutional complaint even before all legal remedies have been exhausted in cases when a competent court has not decided within a reasonable time a claim concerning the applicant’s rights and obligations or a criminal charge against him ... (2) If the constitutional complaint ... under paragraph 1 of this Section is accepted, the Constitutional Court shall determine a time-limit within which a competent court shall decide the case on the merits... (3) In a decision under paragraph 2 of this Article, the Constitutional Court shall fix appropriate compensation for the applicant in respect of the violation found concerning his constitutional rights ... The compensation shall be paid from the State budget within a term of three months from the date when the party lodged a request for its payment.",0,581
474,474,"5. The applicant was born in 1958 and currently lives in Łódź. 6. On 14 February 2007 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of several counts of fraud and incitement to murder committed in an organised criminal group. 7. On 16 February 2007 the Katowice District Court remanded him in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question. It attached importance to the serious nature of those offences and the likelihood of a severe prison sentence being imposed on the applicant. In this connection the court noted that the applicant had admitted to having committed some of the offences of which he had been suspected, including incitement to murder. It also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might go into hiding. As regards the latter, the court relied on the fact that he did not have a permanent place of residence in Poland and that he had already been hiding from the police. Finally, the court underlined that the applicant was a member of an organised criminal group and that some other members of that group were still at large which increased the risk that a detainee, if released, might obstruct the proceedings. 8. The applicant’s appeal against the detention order, likewise his further appeals against decisions extending his detention and all his subsequent applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him, were unsuccessful. 9. In April 2007 the applicant had a heart attack and had to be hospitalised three times during that year. 10. In the course of the investigation, the applicant’s detention was extended on several occasions, namely on 7 May 2007 (to 7 October 2007), 10 September 2007 (to 7 January 2008) and on an unspecified subsequent date. In their detention decisions the courts repeatedly relied on the original grounds given for the applicant’s detention underlining the complexity of the case and the substantial volume of evidence to be examined. They also found no grounds warranting the applicant’s release from detention as provided for by Article 259 of the Criminal Code. In particular, the courts observed that it resulted from medical reports that the applicant could be treated within a penitentiary facility. 11. On 10 June 2008 the Katowice Regional Prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with the Katowice Regional Court. The applicant was charged with an incitement to murder as well as several counts of thefts and extortions committed while acting as a leader of an organised criminal group. The bill of indictment comprised numerous charges brought against several defendants. 12. On 23 June 2008 the case was transferred to the Gliwice Regional Court. 13. In an opinion of 26 February 2009 experts from the cardiology institute of the Medical University in Katowice declared the applicant fit to participate in the proceedings, though limiting the duration of the hearings. 14. During the court proceedings the courts further extended the applicant’s detention, namely on 24 September 2008 (to 14 February 2009), on unspecified subsequent dates and 23 June 2010 (to 30 September 2010). The courts repeated the grounds previously given for the applicant’s continued detention. 15. On 30 June 2010 the Gliwice Regional Court gave judgment. The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to six years’ imprisonment. 16. The applicant and the Prosecutor appealed. 17. On 24 March 2011 the Katowice Court of Appeal decided that the applicant be released from custody and placed under police supervision. The court also barred the applicant from leaving the country. 18. It appears that the appellate proceedings against the applicant are still pending. 19. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of pre-trial detention (tymczasowe aresztowanie), the grounds for its extension, release from detention and rules governing other, so-called “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) are stated in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Gołek v. Poland, no. 31330/02, §§ 27-33, 25 April 2006 and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, §§ 22-23, 4 May 2006.",0,671
479,479,"5. The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Budapest. 6. The applicant is a historian and university professor. His main subject of research is the Second World War and, in particular, the extermination of Jews and Roma. He is the author of numerous publications on the subject. 7. In 2004 a heated public debate took place in Hungary as to whether a statue should be raised to commemorate Pál Teleki. In a wider context, the debate also concerned the question of Hungary’s failure to face up to its role in World War II and the Holocaust, as well as the attitude of Hungarians to this chapter of the country’s twentieth-century history – issues which had political implications, given that certain right-wing parties in the country identified their roots in the pre-World-War-II political system, of which Pál Teleki was an emblematic figure. 8. In that context the applicant publicly stated that Teleki had been one of the most reprehensible figures of Hungarian history, responsible for substantial anti-Semitic legislation as well as for dragging Hungary into World War II. 9. In issue no. 11/2004 of the weekly paper Élet és Irodalom, the applicant published an article on this subject, criticising the right-wing media, including a certain Mr B.T., for embellishing Teleki’s role and for making anti-Semitic statements in the process. The article presented examples of, and refuted, various misconceptions about Teleki’s political acts, endorsed by right-wing authors in order to diminish his responsibility for the persecution of Hungarian Jews, which, in the applicant’s view, amounted to “cautious Jew-bashing”. One of these examples reads as follows: “In B.T.’s charming words, two anti-Semitic laws ‘fell’ within Teleki’s two premierships. ... If we are counting, let us be accurate: not two, but 12 (twelve) anti-Semitic laws are linked to Teleki’s name. ...” The applicant also noted that: “... [I]t is rare that those supporting [the plan to erect a] statue of Teleki are trying to defend their position using overtly anti-Semitic arguments.” 10. Mr B.T. brought an action against the applicant before the Budapest Regional Court. He claimed that his reputation had been tarnished by another passage in the applicant’s article which read as follows: “In the Parliamentary Library’s PRESSDOC database there are hundreds of articles and studies praising Pál Teleki, written in a sometimes uninhibited, sometimes more moderate style. In 1994-95, the extremely anti-Semitic and irredentist Hunnia Brochures devoted a 15-episode series to the ex-PM. The amateur historian [B.T.] wrote several articles extolling the virtues of Pál Teleki – the devout Catholic, the enthusiastic Scout leader – who in his view was an anti-Nazi ‘Realpolitiker’. These articles and studies prompted very little reaction. There are very few of us who, at least from time to time, pick up the products of the right-wing or extreme right-wing press, which, perhaps encouraged by this [indifference], keeps lying, keeps slandering, keeps stirring feeling against and bashing the Jews (zsidóznak), in an increasingly uninhibited way.” 11. According to the plaintiff, the last sentence of the quotation could have been aimed at him and was prejudicial to his reputation. 12. On 1 June 2005 the Regional Court dismissed the action, holding in essence that the impugned sentence, especially the expression “bashing the Jews” did not concern the plaintiff himself but the right-wing and extreme right-wing media in general. 13. On 17 January 2006 the Budapest Court of Appeal reversed that decision on appeal and found for the plaintiff. Relying on sections 75, 78 and 84 of the Civil Code, it ordered the applicant to arrange for the publication of a rectification at his expense and to pay the legal costs, which amounted to 69,000 Hungarian forints (HUF). Assessing the applicant’s statements in the context of the whole article, the Court of Appeal held that the impugned expression could be seen as relating to the plaintiff personally and that the applicant had failed to prove that it was true. In the court’s opinion, to accuse the plaintiff, even contextually, of “Jew bashing” was a statement of fact that presented Mr B.T. in a false light and was thus capable of prejudicing his reputation. 14. On 28 June 2006 the Supreme Court upheld that decision, imposing another HUF 46,000 in legal fees. It reaffirmed that “the impugned statement – which was made, in general terms, with regard to the right-wing (extreme right-wing) press – could also be considered to concern the plaintiff”.",1,733
482,482,"The applicant, Mr James Woodward, is a British national who was born in 1946 and lives in Cheshire. He was represented before the Court by Ms K. Burton, Vale Royal Citizens Advice Bureau, Winsford. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant’s wife died on 8 July 1994, leaving two children born in 1982 and 1984. His claim for widows’ benefits was made in February 2002 and was rejected on 9 March 2002 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows’ benefits because he was not a woman. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law. The applicant was in receipt of child benefit at the time of his claim. The domestic law relevant to this application is set out in Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, §§ 1426, ECHR 2002-IV and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, §§ 40-41, 25 July 2007.",0,205
483,483,"4. The applicant is a limited liability company, founded in 2006, with its seat in Budapest. 5. On 10 August 1992 its predecessor (see paragraph 1 above) requested the Budapest Regional Court to issue an order for payment against another company. 6. The court ordered the respondent to make a payment of 61,369 Hungarian forints (approximately 250 euros (EUR)). Since the latter contested the order, on 5 April 1993 the proceedings became litigation. 7. After having held three hearings, the Regional Court found for the plaintiff in April 1995. On appeal, the Supreme Court quashed this decision in October 1996 and remitted the case to the first-instance court. 8. Between 6 February 1998 and 13 July 2003 the proceedings were stayed, pending the plaintiff’s identifying the respondent’s legal successor. After the latter had finally entered the proceedings, a procedural dispute evolved, at the end of which, apparently in February 2006, the Regional Court noted that, since the original respondent had ceased to exist on 1 April 1993, the proceedings had been interrupted on that date. Thus, all the actions of the parties and all the decisions delivered by the courts after that date were invalid. 9. Eventually, in November 2006 the Regional Court ordered the resumption of the proceedings and transferred the case to the Pest Central District Court, which had acquired jurisdiction to hear the case due to an amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure. 10. On 20 February 2007 the District Court allowed the applicant company to replace the original plaintiff. 11. On 5 December 2007 the District Court found for the applicant company. None of the parties appealed and the decision became final on 22 January 2008.",1,281
487,487,"4. The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in San Cesareo (Rome). 5. P.C. was the owner of a flat in Rome, which she had let to A.C. 6. In a writ served on the tenant on 3 March 1986, the owner informed her of her intention to terminate the lease and summoned her to appear before the Rome Magistrate. 7. By a decision of 12 June 1986, which was made enforceable on 6 November 1986, the Rome Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 31 December 1988. 8. On 30 April 1990, a notice was served on the tenant requiring her to vacate the premises. 9. On 18 May 1990, a notice was served on the tenant informing her that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 11 July 1990. 10. Between 11 July 1990 and 5 October 1999, the bailiff made thirty attempts to recover possession, but they proved unsuccessful as the owner and then the applicant were not entitled to police assistance in enforcing the order for possession. 11. On 21 June 1991, the applicant became the owner of the flat and pursued the enforcement proceedings 12. On 13 October 1997, he made a statutory declaration that he urgently required the premises as accommodation for himself. 13. On 2 May 2000, the applicant recovered possession of the flat. 14. Since 1947 the public authorities in Italy have frequently intervened in residential tenancy legislation with the aim of controlling rents. This has been achieved by rent freezes (occasionally relaxed when the Government decreed statutory increases), by the statutory extension of all current leases and by the postponement, suspension or staggering of the enforcement of orders for possession. The relevant domestic law concerning the extension of tenancies, the suspension of enforcement and the staggering of evictions is described in the Court's judgment in the case of Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, §§ 18-35, ECHR 1999-V. 15. As regards the control of the rents, the evolution of the Italian legislation may be summarised as follows. 16. The first relevant measure was the Law no. 392 of 27 July 1978 which provided machinery for “fair rents” (the so-called equo canone) on the basis of a number of criteria such as the surface of the flat and its costs of realisation. 17. The second step of the Italian authorities dated August 1992. It was taken in the view of progressive liberalisation of the market of tenancies. Accordingly, a legislation relaxing on rent levels restrictions (the so-called patti in deroga) entered into force. Owners and tenants were in principle given the opportunity to derogate from the rent imposed by law and to agree on a different price. 18. Lastly, Law no. 431 of 9 December 1998 reformed the tenancies and liberalised the rents. 19. The tenant is under a general obligation to refund the owner any damages caused in the case of late restitution of the flat. In this regard, Article 1591 of the Italian Civil Code provides: “The tenant who fails to vacate the immovable property is under an obligation to pay the owner the agreed amount until the date when he leaves, together with other remaining damages.” 20. However, Law no. 61 of 1989 set out, inter alia, a limit to the compensation claimable by the owner entitling him to a sum equal to the rent paid by the tenant at the time of the expiration of the lease, proportionally increased according to the cost of living (Article 24 of Law no. 392 of 27 July 1978) plus 20%, along the period of inability to dispose of the possession of the flat. 21. In the judgment no. 482 of 2000, the Constitutional Court was called upon to decide whether such a limitation complied with the Constitution. The Constitutional Court held that it was compatible with the Constitution with regard to periods of time during which the suspension of the evictions was determined by law. The Constitutional Court explained that the introduction of that limitation was intended to settle the tenancies of the time of the emergency legislation, when the housing shortage made the suspension of the enforcement necessary. While evictions were suspended ex lege, the law predetermined the quantum of the reimbursement chargeable to the tenant, both measures being temporary and exceptional. Besides, the interests of the owner were counterbalanced by the exemption for him from the burden to prove the damages. 22. The Constitutional Court declared the limitation to the compensation claimable by the owner unconstitutional with regard to cases where the impossibility for the owner to repossess the flat depended on the conduct of the tenant and was not due to a legislative intervention. Accordingly, it opened the way to owners for the institution of civil proceedings in order to obtain full reparation of the damages caused by the tenant.",1,818
493,493,"9. On 28 July 1996 police officers from the anti-terrorist branch of the İzmir Security Directorate arrested the applicants on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, the PRK-Rızgari. 10. On 5 August 1996 the İzmir State Security Court ordered the applicants' detention on remand. 11. On 28 August 1996 the Chief Public Prosecutor filed an indictment with the İzmir State Security Court charging the applicants with membership of the PRK-Rızgari and undertaking actions against the indivisible integrity of the state. The charges were brought under Articles 125 and 168 of the Criminal Code. 12. In a judgment dated 14 August 1997 the İzmir State Security Court acquitted Ms Melahat Filiz of the charges, holding that there was insufficient evidence to convict her. The court found Mr Nadir Kalkan guilty of the offences under Articles 125 and 168 and sentenced him to capital punishment. 13. On 19 September 1997 Mr Kalkan lodged an appeal with the Court of Cassation. The applicant did not submit any information concerning the outcome of the criminal proceedings against him. 14. Article 19 of the Constitution provides: “Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with the formalities and conditions prescribed by law: ... The arrested or detained person must be brought before a judge within forty-eight hours at the latest or, in the case of offences committed by more than one person, within fifteen days ... These time-limits may be extended during a state of emergency... ... A person deprived of his liberty for whatever reason shall have the right to take proceedings before a judicial authority which shall give a speedy ruling on his case and order his immediate release if it finds that the deprivation of liberty was unlawful. Compensation must be paid by the State for damage sustained by persons who have been victims of treatment contrary to the above provisions, as the law shall provide.” 15. Article 168 of the Criminal Code provides: “Any person who, with the intention of committing the offences defined in Articles ..., forms an armed gang or organisation or takes leadership ... or command of such a gang or organisation or assumes some special responsibility within it shall be sentenced to not less than fifteen years' imprisonment. The other members of the gang or organisation shall be sentenced to not less than five and not more than fifteen years' imprisonment.” 16. Article 125 of the Criminal Code provides: “It shall be an offence, punishable by the death penalty, to commit any act aimed at subjecting the State or any part of the State to domination by a foreign State, diminishing the State's independence or removing part of the national territory from the State's control.” 17. Under Articles 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713 of 12 April 1991), the offences defined in Articles 125 and 168 of the Criminal Code are classified as “terrorist” acts. Pursuant to Article 5 of Law no. 3713, penalties laid down in the Criminal Code as punishment for the offences defined in Articles 3 and 4 of the Act are increased by one half. 18. Under Article 9 of Law no. 3842 on procedure in the state security courts, only these courts can try cases involving the offences defined in Articles 125 and 168 of the Criminal Code. 19. At the material time, Article 30 of Law no. 3842 of 18 November 1992, amending the legislation on criminal procedure, provided that, with regard to offences within the jurisdiction of state security courts, any arrested person had to be brought before a judge within 48 hours at the latest, or, in the case of offences committed by more than one person, within 15 days.",1,636

The first applicant (who is a Cypriot and British citizen) lives in London; the second, third and fourth applicants all reside in Larnaca. The second applicant is a Cypriot citizen, while the third and fourth applicants are British citizens. 8. On 13 August 1974, as the Turkish troops were advancing, the applicants' father left the village of Ayios Avrosios in the District of Kyrenia, where he owned the following immovable properties: (a) plot of land with trees in Kapsala (plot no. 12/7/5/1, sheet/plan 13/15, registration no. 14426, area: hectares (h.) 3, decares (d.) 9, square metres (m²) 818); (b) plot of land with trees in Glifhonera (plot no. 12/7/3, sheet/plan 13/15, registration no. 13911, area: h. 5, d. 6, m² 105); (c) plot of land with trees in Glifhonera (plot no. 12/7/4, sheet/plan 13/15, registration no. 13912, area: h. 5, d. 5, m² 27); (d) plot of land with trees in Apati (plot nos. 13/4 and 15/3, sheet/plan 13/31, registration no. 10106, area: d. 2, m² 342); (e) plot of land with trees in Spati (plot no. 250/3, sheet/plan 13/23, registration no. 7182, area: d. 3, m² 345); (f) plot of land with trees in Apati (plot no. 11/6, sheet/plan 13/31, registration no. 10097, area: m² 437); (g) plot of land with trees in Apati (plot no. 11, sheet/plan 13/31, registration no. 10087, area: d. 4, m² 14); (h) plot of land in Trachonas (plot no. 579, sheet/plan 13/22, registration no. 5927; area: d. 1, m² 673). 9. In support to their claim that their father was the owner of the above-mentioned plots of land, the applicants submitted copies of the title deeds and of the relevant certificates of ownership. 10. On 17 August 1974 the applicants' father tried to visit his property but was arrested by Turkish soldiers. He was released on the same day, since he was a British citizen. 11. On 19 May 1991 the applicants' father died. According to his will, dated 18 May 1988, the plot described under paragraph 8 (a) above was to be inherited by the first applicant and the other plots were to be inherited by the four applicants in equal shares. On 30 July 1991, Mr T. Michaelides was appointed as executor of the will of the applicants' father. The applicants registered their titles with the Department of Lands and Surveys of the Republic of Cyprus on 10 July 1995. The first applicant tried, via the British consular authorities, to visit the properties at issue, but did not obtain permission. 12. In a letter of 2 September 2003, the applicants informed the Court that Turkey was planning to construct a highway at the edge of their properties and that an area of m² 6,000 had been taken for this purpose. The applicants had not been consulted on the matter and no compensation had been offered to them.",1,491
495,495,"The applicant, Bogusław Kawałko, is a Polish national, who was born in 1950 and lives in Wilczyce, Poland. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 13 February 1991 the applicant filed an application for dissolution of joint property with the Legnica District Court (Sąd Rejonowy). The proceedings were terminated by the decision of the Legnica District Court of 3 February 2005, after the entry into force of the 2004 Act. On 10 December 1998, the date on which the application was lodged with the Court, they were pending before the Legnica District Court. On 17 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”) entered into force. It lays down various legal means designed to counteract and/or redress the undue length of judicial proceedings. Section 2 of the 2004 Act reads, in so far as relevant: “1. Parties Section 5 reads, in so far as relevant: “1. A complaint about the unreasonable length of proceedings shall be lodged while the proceedings are pending. ...” Section 12 provides for measures that may be applied by the court dealing with the complaint. It reads, in so far as relevant: “1. The court shall dismiss a complaint which is unjustified. 2. If the court considers that the complaint is justified, it shall find that there was an unreasonable delay in the impugned proceedings. 3. At the request of the complainant, the court may instruct the court examining the merits of the case to take certain measures within a fixed time-limit. Such instructions shall not concern the factual and legal assessment of the case. 4. If the complaint is justified the court may, at the request of the complainant, grant ... just satisfaction in an amount not exceeding PLN 10,000 to be paid by the State Treasury. If such just satisfaction is granted it shall be paid out of the budget of the court which conducted the delayed proceedings.” Section 18 lays down transitional rules in relation to the applications already pending before the Court. It reads, in so far as relevant: “1. Within six months after the date of entry into force of this law persons who, before that date, had lodged a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights ... complaining of a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time guaranteed by Article 6 (1) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ..., may lodge a complaint about the unreasonable length of the proceedings on the basis of the provisions of this law if their complaint to the Court had been lodged in the course of the impugned proceedings and if the Court has not adopted a decision concerning the admissibility of their case. ...” On 18 January 2005 Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) adopted a resolution (no. III SPP 113/04) in which it ruled that while the 2004 Act produced legal effects as from the date of its date of entry into force (17 September 2004), its provisions applied retroactively to all proceedings in which delays had occurred before that date and had not yet been remedied.",0,557

The President of the Section decided of his own motion to grant the applicant anonymity (Rule 47 § 3 of the Rules of Court) and confidentiality of the case file documents (Rule 33 of the Rules of Court). He was represented before the Court by Ms Heini Kotamäki, a lawyer practising in Vantaa. 2. The Finnish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Arto Kosonen of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. In 1999 the applicant started dating the future mother of his child. They were engaged and moved in together. Their cohabitation broke down in November 2000, before the child was born in April 2001. The mother did not allow the applicant to visit his daughter. 5. On 24 February 2004 the applicant’s paternity was confirmed by the District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten). The applicant contacted the child welfare authorities in order to have contact with the mother and the child, but in vain. 6. On 26 April 2004 the applicant requested the District Court to grant him visiting rights to his daughter. 7. On 27 April and 7 May 2004 the child’s mother and her current husband requested that a restraining order be issued against the applicant. 8. On 17 May 2004 the applicant attempted to murder the husband of the child’s mother. 9. On 24 June 2004 the District Court issued a restraining order against the applicant. He was not allowed to approach the child, the mother of the child or her husband. This judgment was final. 10. On 16 May 2005 the District Court refused the applicant’s application for visiting rights. It found that the applicant had never met his daughter, who was by then four years old. However, the applicant had had his paternity confirmed and had also tried to establish contact with his daughter. On the basis of these circumstances, visiting rights could be granted to the applicant. As the daughter did not know her father, the meetings needed to be conducted in the presence of the mother. The applicant being detained, these meetings would have to take place in prison, which could not be regarded as a suitable place for initiating the meetings. Considering the existence of the restraining order, the mother could not be obliged to take the child to prison to meet the father. There were thus no grounds for granting visiting rights to the applicant at that moment. Such rights could be granted later when the applicant was released from prison. 11. The applicant did not appeal against this decision. 12. On 14 November 2007 the applicant requested the District Court to change the previous decision so that the daughter would have the right to visit and to maintain contact with her father first under supervision and later unsupervised. The mother opposed such visiting rights. 13. On 17 January 2008 the District Court refused the applicant’s application. It noted that the applicant had been found guilty of the attempted murder of the current husband of his child’s mother. Although a prison sentence as such did not prevent visits from taking place, the applicant had committed the criminal act in a state of diminished responsibility and, while in prison, he had seriously threatened the life of the child’s mother. It was not in the best interest of the child to meet her father, even under supervision. 14. By letter dated 18 February 2008 the applicant appealed against the decision of 17 January 2008 to the Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovrätten), reiterating the grounds already presented before the District Court. 15. On 25 February 2008 the applicant was released from prison. 16. On 16 October 2008 the Court of Appeal, after having held an oral hearing on 16 September 2008, rejected his appeal. It found that the child was at the time seven years old. Even though the applicant’s circumstances had improved since his release from prison, the child’s mother still had grounds to fear for her life and the life of the child. Moreover, the applicant had been diagnosed as suffering from mental problems which also gave an additional reason to fear for the child’s safety. In such a situation, the best interest of the child required that the applicant was not granted visiting rights. 17. By letter dated 15 December 2008 the applicant further appealed to the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen), reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before the Court of Appeal. 18. On 27 April 2009 the Supreme Court refused the applicant leave to appeal. 19. According to sections 9 and 10 of the Child Custody and Right of Access Act (laki lapsen huollosta ja tapaamisoikeudesta, lagen angående vårdnad om barn och umgängesrätt, Act no. 361/1983), a child has a right to maintain contact with and visit the parent with whom he or she does not live. Custody and right of access must be decided in the best interest of the child.",0,847
505,505,"The applicant, Mr Mark Anthony Norwood, is a United Kingdom national who was born in 1962 and lives in a village near Oswestry, Shropshire. He was represented before the Court by Mr K. Lowry-Mullins, a lawyer practising in London. The applicant was a Regional Organiser for the British National Party (“BNP”: an extreme right wing political party). Between November 2001 and 9 January 2002 he displayed in the window of his first-floor flat a large poster (60 cm x 38 cm), supplied by the BNP, with a photograph of the Twin Towers in flame, the words “Islam out of Britain – Protect the British People” and a symbol of a crescent and star in a prohibition sign. The poster was removed by the police following a complaint from a member of the public. The following day a police officer contacted the applicant by telephone and invited him to come to the local police station for an interview. The applicant refused to attend. The applicant was then charged with an aggravated offence under section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986 (see below), of displaying, with hostility towards a racial or religious group, any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting, within the sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress by it. The applicant pleaded not guilty and argued, in his defence, that the poster referred to Islamic extremism and was not abusive or insulting, and that to convict him would infringe his right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention. On 13 December 2002 he was convicted of the offence by District Judge Browning at Oswestry Magistrates' Court, and fined GBP 300. The applicant appealed to the High Court, which dismissed his appeal on 3 July 2003. Lord Justice Auld held that the poster was “a public expression of attack on all Muslims in this country, urging all who might read it that followers of the Islamic religion here should be removed from it and warning that their presence here was a threat or a danger to the British people”. The applicant was charged with the offence of causing alarm or distress contrary to section 5(1)(b) of the Public Order Act 1986, aggravated in the manner provided by sections 28 and 31 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (as amended by section 39 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001). Section 5 of the 1986 Act provides: “(1) A person is guilty of an offence if he; ... (b) displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting, within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby. (2) An offence under this section may be committed in a public or a private place ... (3) It is a defence for the accused to prove – (a) that he had no reason to believe that there was any person within hearing or sight who was likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress, or (b) that he was inside a dwelling and had no reason to believe that the words or the behaviour used, or the writing, sign or other visible representation displayed would be heard or seen by a person outside that or any other dwelling, or (c) that his conduct was reasonable”. The 1986 Act further provides, in section 6(4): “A person is guilty of an offence under section 5 only if he intends ... the writing, sign or other visible representation to be threatening, abusive or insulting, or is aware that it may be threatening, abusive or insulting ...” The 1998 Act, as amended, introduced a statutory aggravation to a number of offences, including section 5 of the 1986 Act, carrying with it higher maximum penalties. According to sections 28(1)(b) and 31(1)(c) of the 1998 Act, an offence under section 5 of the 1986 Act is “racially or religiously aggravated” if it is “motivated (wholly or partly) by hostility towards members of a racial or religious group based on their membership of that group”.",0,684
506,506,"5. The applicant was born in 1981 and is serving a prison term in the Ryazan Region. 6. The applicant was a student of a State University, which trained law enforcement officers. On 3 March 2001 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of murder. By a judgment of 23 April 2002, the Omsk Regional Court convicted the applicant of theft and murder, and sentenced him to seventeen years' imprisonment. On 10 April 2003 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld the judgment. 7. From 5 to 13 March 2001 the applicant was detained in a temporary detention centre in the town of Omsk. From 14 March 2001 to 10 June 2003 the applicant was detained in Omsk remand centre no. 55/1. 8. According to the applicant, he was kept in the remand centre in cell no. 163 (designed for eight persons) together with at least twenty other inmates. Owing to an insufficient number of beds, they had to sleep in shifts. The cell windows were covered with metal shutters that barred access to natural light and air. In 2003 the applicant was kept in the cell together with eight to ten other persons. 9. The applicant subsequently indicated that in 2001-02 he had been afforded less than two square metres of living space in the cell. The toilet was not separated from the living area. In the absence of any ventilation, the smell spread into the cell. He also alleged that on the days of court hearings in April 2001 he had to get up at 4 a.m. and was taken back at 8 p.m. without any food or drink. 10. The applicant was kept in the remand centre from 15 March 2001 to 10 June 2003. The applicant was placed in cell no. 163, which measured twenty-one square metres and had five beds. This cell was assigned to former law enforcement officers, who had to be kept separately from the other (potentially hostile) detainees. With reference to certificates issued in February 2008 by the acting director of the remand centre, the Government stated that this cell had accommodated three to five detainees during the relevant periods. In support of the above, the Government enclosed statements made in 2008 by three officers serving in the remand centre, who confirmed that the above information was correct and that the conditions of the applicant's detention during the relevant periods had been appropriate. The Government also enclosed a statement made in 2008 by a convict who had been detained in cell no. 163 from April to July 2001. This person stated that during that period there had been five beds and only four detainees and that the material conditions had been acceptable. A similar statement was made in 2008 by another detainee who had been kept in that cell from December 2002 to February 2003. 11. From 30 August to 4 September 2002 the applicant was also kept in cell no. 53, which measured 4.8 square metres and had one bed. 12. According to the Government, the applicant was provided with an individual bed and bedding in both cells. He had access to a shower once a week. He had daily outdoor walks. The metal shutters on the cell window(s) were aimed at preventing inter-cell communication and did not impede access to natural light. The works for removing the shutters were carried out between November 2002 and March 2003. 13. On the days when investigative measures were carried out or hearings were held (June 2001 – September 2002), the applicant had had to get up 6 a.m. and was taken back to the cell before 10 p.m. On those days, he had been fed and had also been able to take food bought by him or received from next of kin. 14. As can be seen from the certificate submitted by the Government, the cell record cards for October 2000 – October 2002 were destroyed on 8 August 2004 after the expiry of the one-year retention period. The registers concerning the population of the remand centre between July 2001 and December 2003 were destroyed on 30 August 2004 after the expiry of the one-year retention period. 15. The following data is given on one of the certificates submitted by the director of the remand centre. The “maximum design capacity” of the remand centre was 1,025 detainees. Between December 2002 and 2004 the design capacity went up to 1,515 detainees owing to the construction of new buildings. As can be seen from another certificate, in 2001 the remand centre accommodated an average of 2,685 persons (to 2,887 beds); in 2002 the figure was 1,999 persons (to 2,305 beds) and in 2003 there were 1,905 persons (to 2,305 beds). 16. The applicant complained to the prosecutor's office of the Omsk Region alleging that he had been ill-treated at the temporary detention centre and that his state of health had deteriorated while in detention. On 11 April 2001 the prosecutor's office rejected his complaints as unfounded. By a letter of 18 December 2003, the prosecutor's office rejected the applicant's further complaint concerning conditions of detention and stated, in particular, that his state of health had been satisfactory, except for a slight deterioration of his eyesight. 17. In February 2004 the applicant complained to the Regional Department for the Execution of Sentences about the allegedly degrading conditions of his detention, referring in particular to the overpopulation in the remand centre and lack of access to natural light and airflow in the cells. By a letter of 2 March 2004, the Penitentiary Office acknowledged the overpopulation problem in “certain cells” in the remand centre in 2001 and 2002 and stated that in 1999 the metal shutters had been partly removed from the cell windows and had been completed removed in March 2003.",1,965
509,509,"The applicant, Hallo Çatıkkaş, is a Turkish national, who was born in 1929 and lives in Adana. He is represented before the Court by Mr Mesut Beştaş, Ms Meral Beştaş and Mr Şerif Yılmaz, lawyers practising in Diyarbakır. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. On 18 May 1995 the applicant was taken into police custody on account of an unnamed intelligence report according to which he was accused of aiding and abetting the PKK. On 19 May 1995 the Şırnak Police Headquarters requested from the local health clinic in İdil that the applicant be examined by a doctor. On an unspecified date the applicant was seen by a doctor in İdil who noted in his medical report that there existed no bruises on the applicant’s body resulting from the use of force. It is further noted in the medical report that the applicant complained of health problems that were only indicated with the initials “HT” and “PIS”. On 25 May 1995 the applicant was interrogated by police officers. During the interrogation he was forced to sign a statement without knowing the contents of it. In the meantime, on 26 May 1995 O.Ö., a former PKK activist, was interrogated by police officers. He alleged that the applicant had aided and abetted the members of the PKK between 1990 and 1992 and that he had been together with the applicant’s son E. in the “mountain team” of the PKK. O.Ö. added that the applicant’s son had fled to Germany using the PKK’s money. He concluded that the applicant’s other son F. had died during an armed clash between the PKK and the security forces in 1988 or in 1989. On 26 May 1995 the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor. He gave a statement with the help of a translator, as he was unable to speak Turkish. The applicant rejected the allegations against him and stated that he had sent his son E. to Germany when he had become aware of his son’s involvement in the PKK. He further stated that his son F. had died while he was working in Istanbul but not during an armed clash. On the same day the applicant was brought before the İdil Magistrate’s Court. He gave a statement with the help of a translator. He reiterated that he had no involvement in the activities of the PKK. The judge ordered his detention on remand. At a hearing held before the Diyarbakır State Security Court on 31 August 1995 the applicant denied the allegations against him. The court rejected the applicant’s request of release pending trial because of the serious nature of the alleged offences and the state of the evidence. In a letter addressed to the Diyarbakır State Security Court and dated 20 November 1995 O.Ö. stated that he had erroneously accused the applicant and that he regretted having done so. On 21 November 1995 the Diyarbakır State Security Court convicted the applicant of aiding and abetting members of the PKK. The court further sentenced him to three years and nine months’ imprisonment under Article 169 of the Turkish Criminal Court and Article 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. On 9 July 1996 the Court of Cassation quashed the decision of the Diyarbakır State Security Court on the grounds that the latter had not established whether or not the applicant’s son F. had died in an armed clash and the applicant’s other son E. had still been in Germany. Furthermore, the Diyarbakır State Security Court should have clarified whether or not the person accused of aiding and abetting the PKK in O.Ö.’s statement of 26 May 1995 had been the applicant. At a hearing held on 17 September 1996 the Diyarbakır State Security Court decided to release the applicant pending trial. On 2 June 1998 the Diyarbakır State Security Court acquitted the applicant. The court found that there existed no evidence to convict the applicant. This decision became final on 6 July 1998 because the parties did not lodge an appeal with the Court of Cassation.",0,682

The applicants Ms Layihe Biç, Mr Resul Biç, Ms Zehra Biç and Ms Hamdiye Biç, were born in 1962, 1982, 1984 and 1993 respectively and live in the village of Yukarıharım, attached to the province of Diyarbakır. 9. On 13 October 1993 İhsan Biç was arrested by security forces in Bismil on suspicion of having participated in an attack on a military convoy, organised by the PKK. In his statement to the gendarmes, he confessed to being a member of the PKK and having participated in the attack against the military convoy. 10. On 8 November 1993 İhsan Biç was brought before the public prosecutor. The same day he was brought before the investigating judge at the Diyarbakır State Security Court, who subsequently ordered his detention on remand. İhsan Biç was accordingly sent to Batman prison. 11. On 1 December 1993 the public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against İhsan Biç in the Diyarbakır State Security Court. In his indictment, he accused him of membership of an illegal organisation, of aiding and abetting the members of this organisation and of having participated in an attack that had been aimed against the security forces. He asked the court to sentence him under Article 125 of the Criminal Code. 12. On 19 September 1995 the Diyarbakır State Security Court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prove that İhsan Biç had taken part in any armed attack, but found him guilty of membership of an illegal organisation. He was accordingly sentenced to twelve years and six months’ imprisonment pursuant to Article 168 § 2 of the Criminal Code. The court further ordered his transfer to the Diyarbakır Prison. 13. On 25 September 1995 İhsan Biç appealed. 14. On 2 October 1996 the Court of Cassation quashed the decision of the State Security Court and sent the case file back for re-examination. 15. The proceedings recommenced before the Diyarbakır State Security Court. The first-instance court decided to keep İhsan Biç in detention on remand during the course of the trials. While the proceedings continued, İhsan Biç was twice operated upon a stomach complaint. At a later date, he was also diagnosed with hepatitis B and subsequently died in the hospital on 9 October 1999 due to liver cirrhosis. 16. The Diyarbakır State Security Court decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings against İhsan Biç after his death.",0,393

The dates of introduction of the applications appear in the table below. The names and dates of birth of the applicants, as well as the names of their representatives appear in the appendix. All of the applicants were found guilty of breaching prison order by decisions of the respective disciplinary boards of prisons in which they are held. Pursuant to the Regulations on the administration of penitentiary institutions and the execution of sentences, various types of disciplinary sanctions were imposed on them. Their appeal requests were rejected respectively by the Enforcement Judges and the Assize Courts, on the basis of the case file, without hearing the applicants or their lawyers, pursuant to Law No. 4675 on Enforcement Judges, dated 16 May 2001.

523,523,"The applicant, born in 1959, is a German national and residing in Wattenbek. In the proceedings before the Court, he is represented by Mr. Traulsen, a lawyer practising in Kiel. On 29 November 1994, in the context of divorce proceedings before the Itzehoe District Court (Amtsgericht), the applicant and Mrs F.E., his wife, concluded a maintenance agreement. Under the terms of this agreement, the applicant committed himself to pay maintenance for his two children Jankl and Yorrick, born in wedlock in 1990 and 1992, in the monthly amount of DEM 241 each, and for Mrs F.E. in the monthly amount of DEM 836. The agreement also indicated the considerations underlying the calculation of the maintenance payments, in particular the applicant’s monthly net income amounting to DEM 2624 and his personal financial needs (Eigenbehalt). On 29 October 1995 the applicant, represented by counsel, applied to the Itzehoe District Court for legal aid with a view to institute proceedings against Mrs F.E., claiming that his maintenance payments for her as well as Jankl and Yorrick be reduced to zero as from 1 November 1995. He submitted that he had remarried in the meantime and that, following the birth of his daughter Pauline in July 1995, he had agreed with his wife to take parental leave from October 1995 to July 1998. His only income was therefore an educational allowance. On 13 December 1995 the Itzehoe District Court dismissed the applicant's request for legal aid on the ground that the intended action lacked sufficient prospect of success. In its decision, the court stated that the action was inadmissible to the extent that the applicant's maintenance obligations towards his children Jankl and Yorrick were concerned, as Mrs F.E. was not the proper defendant in this respect. As regards his claim that his maintenance payments for Mrs F.E. be reduced, the court found that the applicant could not invoke his choice concerning the repartition of roles in his new family and resulting reduction of his income vis-à-vis Mrs F.E. In this respect, the court noted that the applicant was obliged to pay maintenance to Mrs F.E. on the ground that she took care of their two minor children. The court, referring to the case-law of the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), stated that, for the purposes of maintenance, the divorced spouse only had to accept the termination of occupational activities in order to care for a new child, if such a repartition of roles had considerable advantages for the new family. The decisive factor in this respect was the overall amount of the family income. However, the solution envisaged by the applicant did not change the family income. It was only advantageous if his maintenance obligations towards Mrs F.E. and his minor children Jankl and Yorrick would be set aside. In such a situation, the applicant could not evade his primary maintenance obligations towards Mrs F.E. as well as Jankl and Yorrick. On 22 January 1996 the Itzehoe District Court, upon the applicant’s appeal (Beschwerde), confirmed its decision of 13 December 1995. On 28 February 1996 the Schleswig-Holstein Court of Appeal (Oberlandes-gericht) dismissed the applicant's appeal. The Court of Appeal found that the impugned decision was consistent with the constant case-law of the Federal Court of Justice. According to the Court of Appeal, Mrs F.E. was entitled to maintenance under section 1570 of the Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) in order to be in a position to take care of the divorced spouses’ minor children. Referring to section 1582 of the Civil Code, the Court of Appeal observed that, for the purposes of maintenance matters, a divorced spouse taking care of minor children took precedence over the second wife. According to section 1570 of the Civil Code, a divorced spouse can claim maintenance from the other divorced spouse, as long as and to the extent that, taking care of the spouses’ child, he or she cannot be expected to take up gainful occupation. Section 1581 provides that maintenance obligations of a divorced spouse may be reduced in case that the divorced spouse, given his or her earned income, assets and other financial obligations, would risk not to dispose of sufficient own financial means. In determining the maintenance entitlement of a divorced spouse under section 1581, the divorced spouse takes, as a rule, precedence over a new spouse (section 1582). On 7 May 1996 the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) refused to entertain the applicant's constitutional complaint (Verfassungsbeschwerde). Meanwhile, on 1 April 1996 the applicant had accepted part-time occupation of twelve hours per week, with a salary of DEM 1,446.",0,762

On 17 November 1999 the applicants, who were detained in Niğde Prison for being members of the IBDA-C (Great East Islamic Raiders-Front), allegedly incited an insurrection against the prison administration. The prison officers together with soldiers intervened in the uprising in order to bring it to an end. During the incident the applicants and the security forces both sustained injuries which were recorded in medical reports. The security forces drew up an incident report after the operation. 6. On 18 November 1999 the public prosecutor, prison director and prison officers drew up a damage-assessment report concerning the incident. 7. On 22 November 1999 the public prosecutor asked the applicants for their statements. The applicants declared that they wished to make their statements in the presence of their lawyers. 8. On 18 and 23 November 1999, the public prosecutor took statements from ten complainants who were prison officers and one complainant who was a soldier. 9. On 7 December 1999 the applicants gave their statements to the public prosecutor with their lawyer present. The prosecutor asked the applicants whether they had any arguments against the damage-assessment report. The same day, an on-site investigation was conducted inside the prison. 10. On 28 December 1999 the public prosecutor filed an indictment with the Niğde Criminal Court, accusing the applicants of insulting an officer and of insurrection against the prison administration. 11. On 3 January 2000 the Niğde Criminal Court held the first hearing and demanded the presence of the complainants and the four accused, including the applicants, at the following hearing. 12. At the second hearing on 21 March 2000, the Niğde Criminal Court ascertained the applicants' identities and asked them to submit their defence. The applicants maintained that they wished to make their statements in the presence of their lawyers. Accordingly, the court sent a letter to the public prosecutor's office requesting that lawyers from the Niğde Bar Association be assigned to the applicants. At the same hearing, the court took statements from the prison officers who were involved in the incident. 13. On 29 May 2000, two lawyers who were members of the Niğde Bar were assigned to represent the applicants. However, they did not attend any of the ensuing hearings. 14. On 30 May 2000 the court noted that the applicants had been sent to Bandırma Prison for administrative reasons. The court issued a rogatory letter to the Bandırma Criminal Court, requesting that the latter obtain the applicants' statements. 15. On 2 November 2000 the Bandırma Criminal Court, acting under powers delegated to it by the Niğde Criminal Court, pursuant to Article 226 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, took statements from the applicants. According to the minutes of the Bandırma Criminal Court, the applicants were reminded of their rights in accordance with Article 135 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which also included the right to a lawyer. The applicants stated that they were aware of their rights and would defend themselves. 16. The Niğde Criminal Court held six further hearings in the absence of the applicants. 17. On 24 October 2000 the Niğde Criminal Court noted that the applicants' statements had been sent to it by the Bandırma Criminal Court. 18. On 22 November 2001 the Niğde Criminal Court, in absentia, acquitted the applicants of insulting the prison officer, but convicted them of insurrection against the prison administration. The court relied on the applicants' statements, the statements of the complainants, the on-site investigation report, the witness statements and the experts' opinions. The applicants were each sentenced to four years' imprisonment. 19. On 14 March 2002 the applicants appealed against the judgment to the Court of Cassation. In their appeal petitions, they stated that they were only brought before the Niğde Criminal Court once, at the beginning of the proceedings, when the court had only ascertained their identities. They further maintained that the public prosecutor's indictment had not been previously served on them, thus preventing them from submitting their defence, and that they had requested legal representation, which had not been forthcoming. They finally submitted that they were not asked to submit their final statements and the judgment was pronounced in their absence. 20. On 25 June 2002 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the Niğde Criminal Court. 21. On 1 June 2005 the new Criminal Code came into force. Consequently, the Nigde Assize Court has scheduled a hearing for 20 March 2007 with a view to adjusting the applicants' sentences, pursuant to the provisions of the new Criminal Code.",1,774
529,529,"The applicant, Mr Tamás Dányádi, is a Hungarian national who was born in 1975 and lives in Székesfehérvár, Hungary. He is represented before the Court by Mr E. Petruska, a lawyer practising in Budapest. The Hungarian Government (“the Government”) are represented by Mr L. Höltzl, Agent, Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. After having searched his home – with no result – on 14 October 1993 and heard two witnesses on 15 October 1993, the Budapest Police Department interrogated the applicant on 18 October 1993. He was suspected of bodily assault, allegedly having stabbed Mr K. on 20 September 1993. On 31 October 1993 the applicant retained Mr Petruska as defence counsel. The latter’s request of 2 November for access to the investigation documents which had been created prior to his appointment was rejected by the police and, finally, by the public prosecutor’s office on 10 December 1993. The lawyer eventually had access to the entirety of the case file on termination of the investigation. On 30 December 1993 the Budapest XX/XXI District Public Prosecutor’s Office indicted the applicant for severe bodily assault, noting that the victim had had a 2.5 cm wide, 6 cm deep knife wound. The Budapest XX/XXI/XXIII District Court held a hearing on 12 April 1995. At that hearing the victim described the weapon used as a knife with a blade approximately 3-4 cm in width. In another case, on 21 November 1995 the Public Prosecutor’s Office indicted the applicant for the offence of causing unlawful damage. This case was joined to the first proceedings on 18 July 1997. Meanwhile, in the principal proceedings a forensic opinion was obtained on 17 June 1996. Hearings took place on 8 November 1996, 8 April and 25 June 1997. In yet another case, on 12 August 1997 the Public Prosecutor’s Office indicted the applicant for the offence of riotous behaviour. This case was joined to the existing proceedings on 8 October 1997. On that date, a hearing took place in the joined proceedings. Further hearings were held on 11 December 1997 and 13 March 1998. On 12 June 1998 another forensic opinion was obtained. Additional hearings took place on 17 July and 15 September 1998. At the hearing of 29 October 1998, the prosecution and the defence made their final submissions. Defence counsel argued inter alia that the weapon as described by the victim could not possibly have caused the injury suffered. On that date the court found the applicant guilty as charged and imposed a cumulative sentence of one year and four months’ imprisonment, suspended for two years. The court observed that the forensic opinion corroborated the victim’s account of the incident and the weapon used, although the latter was nowhere to be found. Regarding the severe bodily assault committed by the applicant, which was punishable with imprisonment of up to five years, the court took into account as a mitigating factor the substantial lapse of time since the offence had been committed. On appeal, on 17 March 2000 the Budapest Regional Court disjoined the case concerning the assault and, quashing the first-instance judgment in this respect, remitted the case. It acquitted the applicant of the charge of causing unlawful damage and reduced his sentence for riotous behaviour to a fine. For reasons of competence, on 10 May 2000 another bench of the Regional Court was appointed to retry the applicant for assault. In the resumed proceedings, hearings took place on 27 March and 7 June 2001. On that date, the defence had its only opportunity ever to question the prosecution’s main witness in the case. Further hearings were held on 5 July and 20 September 2001. On that date the Regional Court convicted the applicant of aggravated bodily assault and sentenced him to one year’s imprisonment, suspended for two years. The court relied on the testimonies of the victim and several witnesses, the opinion of a forensic expert and the inspection of the crime scene. The court observed the substantial lapse of time since the offence had been committed and took it into account as a mitigating factor. On appeal, on 25 June 2002 the Supreme Court held a hearing. According to the minutes of the hearing, the applicant’s lawyer argued inter alia that: “the applicant’s [procedural] rights had been seriously prejudiced [in the proceedings before the Regional Court]”. In his submissions to the Court, the applicant explains that this statement of his lawyer, as presented orally to the Supreme Court, concerned the alleged deficiency of the Regional Court’s reasoning. In its 4-page decision served on 9 September 2002, the Supreme Court upheld the first-instance judgment. Completing the findings of fact on certain points, it held that the reasoning of the Regional Court’s judgment was, as such, sufficient and the establishment of the facts correct. It explained that, contrary to the defence’s arguments, no breach of the prohibition of reformatio in peius had taken place. Finally, it observed that the sentence imposed by the first-instance court was lawful. Section 44 § 4 of the (Old) Code of Criminal Procedure, as in force in the material period, provides that the defendant shall have access to the case file on termination of the investigation.",0,880
539,539,"The applicant, Elfriede Strasser, is an Austrian national, born in 1947 and living in Salzburg. She is represented before the Court by Mr F. Hitzenbichler, a lawyer practising in Salzburg. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 5 June 1989, the applicant filed an action with the Salzburg District Court (Bezirksgericht) requesting the repayment of rent and of capital expenditure (Investitionskostenaufwand) from her lessor. In these and the subsequent proceedings the applicant was represented by counsel. On 18 December 1991, the District Court dismissed the action. The applicant appealed against this decision on 6 February 1992. On 4 May 1992, the Salzburg Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) referred the case back to the Salzburg District Court requesting that additional evidence be taken. As regards the capital expenditure the applicant appealed against this decision on 4 June 1992. On 31 August 1992, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the Court of Appeal’s decision to refer the case back to the Salzburg District Court for the taking of additional evidence. The District Court held hearings on 16 March and 7 June 1993. An expert was appointed on 17 August 1993, who submitted his opinion on 28 September 1994. Following a change of the competent judge a further hearing was held on 2 May 1995 where the expert was present and orally explained his opinion. On 7 July 1995, the District Court, having regard to the submissions of the parties, the witnesses, and the experts, rendered a partial judgment granting the applicant’s claim for repayment of certain sums which she had paid in rent. Her claim for repayment of capital expenditure was admitted in substance, the precise amount remaining to be fixed after the taking of further evidence. On 27 November 1995, the Salzburg Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal as far as the claim for capital expenditure was concerned. The defendant filed a further appeal on points of law on 6 February 1996. Thereupon, on 25 October 1996, the Supreme Court confirmed the Court of Appeal’s decision as to the claim for repayment of rent, but agreeing with the defendant dismissed the applicant’s claim for compensation for capital expenditure finding that the Court of Appeal had wrongly applied the law in this respect. The decision was served on 2 December 1996. Section 91 of the Courts Act (Gerichtsorganisationsgesetz), which has been in force since 1 January 1990, provides as follows. ""(1) If a court is dilatory in taking any procedural step, such as announcing or holding a hearing, obtaining an expert’s report, or preparing a decision, any party may submit a request to this court for the superior court to impose an appropriate time-limit for the taking of the particular procedural step; unless sub-section (2) of this section applies, the court is required to submit the request to the superior court, together with its comments, forthwith. (2) If the court takes all the procedural steps specified in the request within four weeks after receipt, and so informs the party concerned, the request is deemed withdrawn unless the party declares within two weeks after service of the notification that it wishes to maintain its request. (3) The request referred to in sub-section (1) shall be determined with special expedition by a chamber of the superior court consisting of three professional judges, one of whom shall preside; if the court has not been dilatory, the request shall be dismissed. This decision is not subject to appeal.""",0,583
542,542,"1. The applicant, Mr Oleg Nikolayevich Liman, is a Ukrainian national, who was born in 1973. Before being imprisoned the applicant lived in Slovyansk, Donetsk Region. 2. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr N. Kulchytskyy. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. On 16 August 2002 the applicant and two accomplices attacked and robbed Mr K.S., Ms K.N. and Mr K.Yu. in their home. 5. On 27 August 2002 the applicant was arrested by police officers after being identified by Ms K.N. 6. On 30 May 2003 the Slovyansk Town Court (“the Town Court”) found the applicant guilty of robbery and sentenced him to ten years and six months’ imprisonment, with confiscation of his property. The applicant was represented by three lawyers in those proceedings. 7. On 26 August 2003 and 17 June 2004 the Donetsk Court of Appeal (“the Court of Appeal”) and the Supreme Court, respectively, upheld the judgment of 30 May 2003. 8. On 2 July 2004 the Town Court, in the course of civil proceedings, ordered the applicant to pay 84,837.10 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) in respect of pecuniary damage and UAH 20,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage in favour of Mr K.S. and Ms K.N in compensation for the crime he had committed against them. 9. On 21 July 2004 the applicant appealed against that judgment. The appeal was handwritten. 10. On 17 September 2004 the Court of Appeal remitted the appeal to the Town Court for a decision on whether it had been prepared in accordance with the procedural requirements. 11. On 29 September 2004 the Town Court found that the applicant’s appeal had not been properly submitted. The court noted, in particular, that the appeal had not been typewritten; it did not contain the necessary information about the other parties to the proceedings; it was not sufficiently reasoned; no copies thereof had been enclosed for the other parties; and the court fee for lodging an appeal had not been paid. The court therefore invited the applicant to rectify those shortcomings by 18 October 2004. 12. On 18 October 2004 the Town Court found that the applicant had not rectified the shortcomings in his appeal and returned it to him unexamined. 13. On 17 November 2004 the applicant submitted a new appeal against the judgment of 2 July 2004. The appeal was again handwritten. No evidence was enclosed suggesting that the applicant had paid a court fee, and the applicant did not request exemption from payment of the court fee. 14. On 29 November 2004 the Court of Appeal returned the appeal to the Town Court and suggested that it consider whether any steps should be taken to provide the applicant with the requisite facilities to prepare his appeal in accordance with the procedural formalities. 15. On 20 March 2005 the applicant signed an agreement with lawyer G. according to which that lawyer was to assist him in his criminal case. 16. On 21 March 2005 the Town Court extended the time-limit for appealing against the judgment of 2 July 2004 and accepted the applicant’s appeal. That hearing was attended by lawyer G. 17. On an unspecified date the case was sent to the Court of Appeal. 18. On 11 May 2005 the Court of Appeal found that the applicant’s appeal was again not typewritten. It therefore refused to open appeal proceedings and returned the case file to the Town Court. 19. The relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure of 18 July 1963 (effective until 1 September 2005, the date when the Code of Civil Procedure of 18 March 2004 came into force) can be found in the judgment of Volovik v. Ukraine (no. 15123/03, §§ 24-31, 6 December 2007).",0,632
546,546,"4. The applicants were respectively born in 1938, 1943 and 1948 and live in Rome. 5. The applicants' father was the owner of a flat in Rome, which he had let to C.C. 6. In a writ served on the tenant on 24 January 1984, the applicants' father informed the tenant that he intended to terminate the lease on expiry of the term and summoned him to appear before the Rome Magistrate. 7. By a decision of 17 April 1984, which was made enforceable on 2 May 1984, the Rome Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 16 April 1985. 8. On 10 March 1985, the applicants' father served notice on the tenant requiring him to vacate the premises. 9. On 3 April 1987, the applicants' father served notice on the tenant informing him that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 12 May 1987. 10. On 14 February 1992, the applicants' father died and they inherited the flat. Subsequently they became parties to the eviction proceedings. 11. Between 12 May 1987 and 15 February 2000, the bailiff made fifty-seven attempts to recover possession. Each attempt proved unsuccessful, as neither the applicants' father nor themselves were entitled to police assistance in enforcing the order for possession. 12. On an unspecified date in February 2000, reaching an agreement with the tenant, the applicants recovered possession of the flat. 13. Since 1947 the public authorities in Italy have frequently intervened in residential tenancy legislation with the aim of controlling rents. This has been achieved by rent freezes (occasionally relaxed when the Government decreed statutory increases), by the statutory extension of all current leases and by the postponement, suspension or staggering of the enforcement of orders for possession. The relevant domestic law concerning the extension of tenancies, the suspension of enforcement and the staggering of evictions is described in the Court's judgment in the case of Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, §§ 18-35, ECHR 1999-V. Lastly, a suspension of the enforcement of the orders for possession until 30 June 2004 was introduced by Legislative Decree no. 147 of 24 June 2003, which became Law no. 200 of 1 August 2003. 14. As regards the control of the rents, the evolution of the Italian legislation may be summarised as follows. 15. The first relevant measure was the Law no. 392 of 27 July 1978 which provided machinery for “fair rents” (the so-called equo canone) on the basis of a number of criteria such as the surface of the flat and its costs of realisation. 16. The second step of the Italian authorities dated August 1992. It was taken in the view of progressive liberalisation of the market of tenancies. Accordingly, a legislation relaxing on rent levels restrictions (the so-called patti in deroga) entered into force. Owners and tenants were in principle given the opportunity to derogate from the rent imposed by law and to agree on a different price. 17. Lastly, Law no. 431 of 9 December 1998 reformed the tenancies and liberalised the rents. 18. The tenant is under a general obligation to refund the owner any damages caused in the case of late restitution of the flat. In this regard, Article 1591 of the Italian Civil Code provides: “The tenant who fails to vacate the immovable property is under an obligation to pay the owner the agreed amount until the date when he leaves, together with other remaining damages.” 19. However, Law no. 61 of 1989 set out, inter alia, a limit to the compensation claimable by the owner entitling him to a sum equal to the rent paid by the tenant at the time of the expiration of the lease, proportionally increased according to the cost of living (Article 24 of Law no. 392 of 27 July 1978) plus 20%, along the period of inability to dispose of the possession of the flat. 20. In the judgment no. 482 of 2000, the Constitutional Court was called upon to decide whether such a limitation complied with the Constitution. The Constitutional Court held that it was compatible with the Constitution with regard to periods of time during which the suspension of the evictions was determined by law. The Constitutional Court explained that the introduction of that limitation was intended to settle the tenancies of the time of the emergency legislation, when the housing shortage made the suspension of the enforcement necessary. While evictions were suspended ex lege, the law predetermined the quantum of the reimbursement chargeable to the tenant, both measures being temporary and exceptional. Besides, the interests of the owner were counterbalanced by the exemption for him from the burden to prove the damages. 21. The Constitutional Court declared the limitation to the compensation claimable by the owner unconstitutional with regard to cases where the impossibility for the owner to repossess the flat depended on the conduct of the tenant and was not due to a legislative intervention. Accordingly, it opened the way to owners for the institution of civil proceedings in order to obtain full reparation of the damages caused by the tenant.",1,858
548,548,"The applicant, Zakria Sadiq Mir, is a citizen of the United Kingdom born in 1937. A lawyer and banker by profession, he resides in Zurich in Switzerland. After marrying in 1968 the applicant and his then wife moved to the United Kingdom where they took up residence with their two children, born in 1967 and 1970 respectively. In 1972 they moved to Switzerland, although from 1975-1978 the applicant resided in the United States and the United Kingdom. He then returned to Switzerland where he obtained annual residence permits (Aufenthaltsbewilligung). Meanwhile, having been separated from his wife since 1975, their marriage was dissolved in 1977. Subsequently, the applicant was frequently unemployed and intermittently depended on social assistance. In 1978, and again in 1980, 1983, 1984 and 1990, the Police Directorate (Polizeidirektion) of the Canton of Zurich refused the applicant’s request for a long-term residence authorisation (Niederlassungsbewilligung) in view of his continuing tax and alimony debts and his dependence on public welfare. In 1985 the applicant was in fact warned by the Government (Regierungsrat) of the Canton of Zurich that he would be expelled from Switzerland if he failed to comply with his alimony payments and if he continued to be a burden on the social assistance fund. In 1994 the applicant’s residence permit was renewed until 1995. In 1996 the Aliens’ Police requested the applicant to regularise his status in Switzerland. The applicant’s further request for a domicile authorisation was refused by the Police Directorate on 13 November 1996, which, furthermore, ordered him to leave the Canton of Zurich by 31 January 1997. In its decision, the Police Directorate noted, inter alia, that the applicant was unemployed and had not tried to find employment; he had debts amounting to 53,000 Swiss francs (CHF), and the social assistance had paid out over CHF 140,000 to him. The applicant’s appeal against this decision was dismissed by the Government of the Canton of Zurich on 29 April 1998. On 27 November 1998 the Federal Court (Bundesgericht) rejected the applicant’s administrative law appeal (Verwaltungsgerichtsbeschwerde). In its judgment, the court found that the applicant could not rely on Article 8 of the Convention as he was no longer married and his children were adults. Moreover, the applicant could not claim to have any particular ties with Switzerland in view of his unemployment, his debts, and his dependency on social assistance. Warnings had also not been heeded. On 17 December 1998 the Aliens’ Police of the Canton of Zurich ordered the applicant to leave Switzerland by 28 February 1999. On 22 December 1998 the applicant filed with the Federal Court a public law appeal (staatsrechtliche Bescherde) against the decision of 29 April 1998. When informed by the Federal Court that he had missed the time-limit for appealing, the applicant insisted on pursuing his appeal, pointing out that the decision of 29 April 1998 had not contained a statement as to possible remedies available to him. On 19 January 1999 the Federal Court declared the applicant’s public law appeal inadmissible. On 1 October 1999 the applicant was brought by the police to Zurich airport where he boarded a plane to London. On 10 November 1999 the Zurich District Court (Bezirksgericht) fined the applicant CHF 40 for failing to comply with the order to leave Switzerland by 28 February 1999. On 13 November 1999 the applicant married a Swiss citizen and on the same day moved to Zurich. It appears that he subsequently obtained an annual residence permit.",0,579

On 17 October 2001 the applicant was discharged from his civil service post following his previous criminal conviction by a martial law court. The conviction had been finalised by the Military Court of Cassation's decision of 11 November 1997. 5. On 4 January 2002 the applicant brought an action before the Samsun Administrative Court to annul the discharge order. 6. On 5 June 2002 the Samsun Administrative Court rejected the applicant's request. 7. On 7 February 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the Samsun Administrative Court. The written opinions of the public prosecutor and of the judge rapporteur (“tetkik hakimi”) concerning his appeal request were not communicated to the applicant. 8. On 31 December 2007 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's request for rectification of its previous decision. 9. On 11 January 2002 the applicant was discharged from his civil service post after a disciplinary decision. Criminal proceedings were also commenced against the applicant on the same grounds as those which had led to his discharge. 10. On 15 March 2002 the applicant brought an action before the Ankara Administrative Court to annul the discharge order. 11. On 25 June 2002 the Ankara Assize Court acquitted the applicant of the offences with which he had been charged. On 22 March 2004 the Court of Cassation upheld the applicant's acquittal. 12. In the meantime, on 31 March 2003 the Ankara Administrative Court refused the applicant's request to annul the discharge order. Relying on Section 131 of the Law on Civil Servants (Law no. 657), the administrative court held that the applicant's acquittal of the criminal charges did not absolve him from the disciplinary sanction. 13. On 26 April 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the Ankara Administrative Court. The written opinions of the public prosecutor and of the judge rapporteur concerning his appeal request were not communicated to the applicant. 14. On 23 January 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's rectification request. The final decision was served on the applicant on 4 March 2008. 15.

551,551,"1. The applicant, Mr Mehmet Lütfi Koçak, is a Turkish national who was born in 1982 and lives in Mersin. He was represented before the Court by Mr A. Erkol, a lawyer practising in Mersin. 3. On 27 September 2002 the applicant was operated on in Adana Numune Hospital. In the consultation and examination form it was noted that the applicant was complaining of weakness in the right leg as well as occasional urinary incontinence and that he had tethered cord syndrome, a disorder of the spinal column. 4. On 30 September 2002 his catheter was removed. However, as he was not able to pass urine it was reinserted. 5. He was discharged from the hospital on 7 October 2002. 6. He was admitted to the hospital once again on 12 November 2002 for inability to pass urine. He was discharged on 21 November 2002. In the discharge summary form it was noted that the applicant had a permanent catheter. He was diagnosed with neurogenic bladder and prescribed with the use of a catheter six times a day. 7. On 22 June 2004 the applicant obtained a medical report from the health board of the Hospital of the Mersin University School of Medicine. It reads as follows: “The applicant who came to our hospital on 17 June 2004...was examined, treated and given recommendations at the Urology Department. For your information. Admission-Discharge Dates: 17/6/2004 Diagnosis: Neurogenic bladder (“urinary dysfunction”) Other issues: The catheterisation of the patient with...type of catheter six times a day for a period of one year is convenient.” 8. On 13 September 2004 he applied to the Ministry of Health seeking compensation and lodged a criminal complaint against the doctor concerned for breach of duty. 9. On the basis of a medical expert opinion given by two spinal surgeons on 7 October 2004, the Ministry of Health rejected the applicant’s request on 19 October 2004. 10. On 1 November 2004 he initiated compensation proceedings against the administration. 11. On 6 January 2005 the Governorship of Adana did not grant the permission sought for the prosecution of the doctor concerned, basing its decision on a preliminary investigation report. It was observed that the patient’s symptoms had existed prior to the surgery and that they consisted of the development of his progressive neurological disease, namely tethered cord spinal syndrome. On 7 April 2005 the public prosecutor terminated the investigation for this reason. 12. Before the Adana Administrative Court the administration claimed that the civil action was time-barred; that in any case the applicant’s complaints had pre-dated the impugned operation; that the applicant had been operated on 27 September 2002 for tethered spinal cord syndrome, and that the medical expert evidence had confirmed that the doctor concerned had not been negligent. 13. The Adana Administrative Court noted that on 25 September 2002 the applicant had been diagnosed with tethered spinal cord syndrome, the symptoms of which included loss of bladder control. Having observed that the applicant had been hospitalised for urinary incontinence on 12 November 2002, it stated: “...even assuming that at the time of the diagnosis he had not been suffering from this symptom, since he was admitted to the Urology Department on 12 November 2002 for inability to pass urine without the use of a catheter it should be held that he should have been aware of his condition by that date at the latest.” 14. The first-instance court concluded that for the purposes of section 13 of the Administrative Procedure Act the one-year time-limit had started running on 12 November 2002 and that the case lodged on 1 November 2004 was therefore time-barred. It declared the case inadmissible on 22 June 2006. 15. The applicant appealed against the decision. 16. The public prosecutor at the Supreme Administrative Court pointed out that the time should be calculated from the date on which the person concerned had become aware of the damage. He referred to paragraph 1 of section 13 of the Administrative Procedure Act, which stipulates that individuals whose rights have been violated by an administrative action should apply to the administration concerned for redress within one year of the date on which they were notified or otherwise became aware of the administrative action, and in any case within five years of the date of the action. He proposed that the judgment of the first-instance court should be quashed, holding that the applicant had become aware on 22 June 2004 that his neurogenic bladder might have been connected to the surgical operation. 17. The Supreme Administrative Court upheld the decision of the firstinstance court on 27 October 2008. The final decision was served on the applicant on 5 January 2009.",0,781

The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant’s wife died on 29 May 1993. His formal claim for widows’ benefits was made on 28 June 2002 and was rejected on 8 July 2002 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows’ benefits because he was not a woman. On 23 July 2002 the applicant appealed and reconsideration took place on 30 August 2002. The previous decision was upheld. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law. The Government submitted that the applicant was not in receipt of child benefit at the time of his claim. The applicant, who had initially submitted that he had ceased to be eligible for child benefit at some time in 2002, failed to submit any comments in reply, although invited to do so. The domestic law relevant to this application is set out in Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, §§ 1426, ECHR 2002-IV, and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, §§ 40-41, 25 July 2007.",0,255
557,557,"4. The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Yenakiyeve. 5. In 1999 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against his former employers, the State-owned mines “Yenakiyivska” and “Poltavska”, seeking compensation for damage to his health. 6. On 12 February 1999 the Yenakiyeve Court (Єнакіївський міський суд) ordered the mine “Poltavska” to pay the applicant a lump sum of 10,922.79 hryvnyas (UAH). On 22 March 1999 the Donetsk Regional Court (the “Regional Court”; Донецький обласний суд) amended this judgment, having additionally awarded the applicant arrears in monthly allowances for the period of October 1996 – October 1999. 7. On 22 March 1999 the Regional Court ordered the mine “Yenakiyivska” to pay the applicant the total UAH 10,263.24 in monthly allowance arrears. 8. After the above decisions had become final and the enforcement proceedings had been instituted in their respect, the applicant unsuccessfully requested the judicial authorities to re-open the proceedings, seeking higher compensation. 9. According to the Government, the judgments debts were fully paid to the applicant in several instalments, last payments having been made in September 2003. To this end, the Government presented copies of the decisions to terminate the enforcement proceedings taken on 19 and 26 September 2003 by the Bailiffs (Відділ Державної виконавчої служби Єнакіївського міського управління юстиції) in respect of the mines “Yenakiyivska” and “Poltavska” respectively. 10. The applicant maintained that he had received only a part of the judgments debt due to him. He did not, however, specify the outstanding amount and provided no information on whether he had challenged the Bailiffs' decision to terminate the enforcement proceedings. 11. After the case had been communicated to the Government, the applicant additionally submitted a number of documents concerning his other disputes and proceedings against various parties, however, he neither described the relevant facts, nor articulated any separate complaints in their respect. 12.

565,565,"The applicant is a Polish national, born in 1948. He is a lawyer and lives in Warsaw. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 27 July 1993 the applicant filed with the Warsaw District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) an action against the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for which he used to work as a vice-consul at the Polish Consulate General in New York until 31 August 1992. He claimed compensation for the airplane tickets he had purchased for himself and his family in order to return from New York to Poland. On 5 August 1993 the applicant’s case was transferred to the Second Civil Section of the Warsaw District Court. On 2 December 1993 the Second Civil Section decided that the case should be transmitted to the Labour Section of the Warsaw District Court as it concerned a claim based on labour law. On 23 March 1994 the case was received by the registry of the Labour Section. The first hearing was fixed for 23 June 1994. On 22 June 1994 the defendant requested the court to postpone the hearing as its counsel was on leave and the applicant’s written submissions were extensive. During the hearing held on 23 June 1994 the court decided to adjourn it until 6 October 1994. On 6 October 1994 the hearing was adjourned until 12 January 1995 as the presiding judge was on sick leave. On 17 October 1994 the court requested the defendant to submit a reply to the applicant’s statement of claim. During the hearing held on 12 January 1995 the court decided that a certain M.B., an employee of the defendant, should be heard as a witness and adjourned the hearing until 20 April 1995. At the same time the court instructed the defendant to provide it with the address of M.B. On 24 January 1995 the defendant informed the court that M.B. was living in New York where he had been appointed as a consul at the Consulate General of the Republic of Poland. The hearing held on 20 April 1995 was adjourned as the witness M.B. was not present. On 11 September 1995 and 11 October 1996 the District Court requested the Department of International Law of the Ministry of Justice to take evidence from M.B. In a letter of 15 January 1997 the Ministry of Justice informed the President of the District Court that it faced difficulties in taking evidence from M.B. It also advised the President that he might wish to prepare another request for taking evidence from that witness and submit it directly to the concerned Polish diplomatic mission in the United States. On 9 July 1997 the District Court again requested the Ministry of Justice to assist it in taking evidence from M.B. On 22 July 1997 the defendant submitted a duly certified written statement made by M.B. On an unspecified date in 1997 M.B. returned to Warsaw, where he continued to work for the defendant. The next hearing held on 10 December 1997 at 11 a.m. was adjourned after the counsel for the defendant informed the court that M.B. could not attend since he was on vacation outside Warsaw. The applicant submits that in the afternoon of that day he made a phone call to M.B. who was in his office in Warsaw and who informed him that although formally he was on leave, he had nevertheless come to work on that day. The hearing held on 8 April 1998 was adjourned after the court took evidence from M.B. and requested the applicant to submit copies of insurance policies which he had purchased before his departure from the United States. The hearing held on 25 May 1998 was adjourned due to the illness of the presiding judge. On 28 September 1998 the last hearing before the first-instance court took place. On 5 October 1998 the Warsaw District Court delivered a judgment dismissing the applicant’s action. On 3 November 1998 the applicant was served with the reasoned judgment of the District Court. On 4 November 1998 the applicant lodged with the Warsaw Regional Court an appeal against the judgment of the District Court. On 10 November 1998 the applicant’s appeal was transmitted to the defendant. On 5 January 1999 the defendant submitted to the Warsaw Regional Court its reply. On 7 January 1999 the Regional Court held a hearing. On 21 January 1999 the court delivered a judgment in which it awarded the applicant USD 1,789 together with interest and dismissed the remaining part of his claim. On 22 April 1999 the applicant lodged with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) a cassation appeal. On 22 July 1999 the Supreme Court rejected the appeal because such a remedy was not provided in the applicant’s case since his claim was below the PLN 5,000 threshold set by the legislation for cassation appeals. In addition, the court observed that the cassation appeal had been lodged by the applicant instead of qualified counsel. On 31 December 1999 the applicant lodged with the Supreme Court a further appeal challenging the decision rejecting his cassation appeal. On 23 March 2000 the Supreme Court rejected the appeal because such a remedy was not provided by law.",0,872
566,566,"The applicant [Mr Costantino Nardella] is an Italian national who was born in 1962 and lives in Foggia. He was represented before the Court by Mr G. Di Mattia, a lawyer in Foggia. While he was a first-year law student at the University of Urbino, Mr Nardella applied to the Student Services Office for a bursary (assegno di studio) for the academic year 1981/82 following a competition notice issued in conformity with Law no. 54/79. He stated that he was a member of a family whose income did not exceed the ceiling of four million Italian lire (ITL) above which the bursary, which amounted to ITL 500,000, could not be granted. In a decision of 21 December 1981, of which the applicant was notified on 28 January 1982, the governing body of the Urbino University Student Services rejected Mr Nardella’s application on the ground that his family’s income exceeded the prescribed limit. The Director of Student Services informed the applicant that he could challenge the decision in the Regional Administrative Court. On 15 February 1982 the applicant served notice on the governing body of the Student Services that he was appealing to the President of the Republic. On 27 September 1989 he asked the governing body for information as to progress of the proceedings. On 13 October 1989 the Student Services Office replied that they had none and advised him to address his enquiry to the President of the Republic. On 4 June 1992, in reply to a letter from the applicant received on 2 June 1992, the office of the President of the Republic informed the applicant that the procedure in question was governed by Presidential Decree no. 1199 of 1971 and that his letter had been forwarded to the Ministry for the Universities and Research Studies, which would be dealing with it. According to information provided by the applicant, the proceedings were still pending on 12 December 1998. Special appeals to the President of the Republic (ricorso straordinario al Presidente della Repubblica) are governed by Presidential Decree no. 1199 of 24 November 1971. They are non-contentious administrative appeals by which final decisions can be challenged. They are lodged by the appellant directly with the head of State and are limited to a review of the lawfulness of the decision being challenged. A special appeal precludes bringing an action in the administrative courts. It follows that once an appellant challenges an administrative decision by way of a special appeal to the President of the Republic, he or she can no longer bring an action in the courts. Since an action in the courts offers better guarantees than a special appeal, the other party (controinteressato) can, within sixty days of receiving notice of such an appeal, request that it be heard in the administrative courts. A special appeal must be lodged within 120 days of service, communication or knowledge of the decision being challenged. It must, within the same time period, be served on the authority which made the decision and be lodged with the relevant ministry (or the authority which made the decision, which must then forward it to the relevant ministry). The relevant ministry investigates the case and must complete its investigation within 120 days of the expiry of the time allowed to the other party to submit their observations. When that time has expired, the appellant can ask the relevant ministry whether the appeal has been forwarded to the Consiglio di Stato for an opinion, as is compulsory, and, if no reply or a negative reply is received, can himself file a copy of the appeal with the Consiglio di Stato. On a proposal by the appropriate minister, the President of the Republic makes a ruling by decree. An application can be made for review of that decree. An appeal could also be lodged with the administrative courts even if there is no express legal provision to that effect.",0,652
567,567,"5. The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Budapest. 6. On 18 March 2003 the Eger District Public Prosecutor’s Office indicted the applicant and two other individuals for aggravated extortion. The applicant was assisted by defence counsel of his choice. After hearings held on 16 June and 8 October, on 13 October 2003 the District Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to 3½ years’ imprisonment. The court relied on evidence given by the victim and several witnesses. 7. The prosecution appealed to have the sentence increased, while the applicant appealed to be acquitted or to have his sentence reduced. He also proposed that two further witnesses be heard. 8. At deliberations held in camera on 20 February 2004, the Heves County Regional Court upheld the applicant’s conviction, while increasing his sentence to 4 years’ imprisonment. Neither the applicant nor his lawyer was present. In its reasoning, the court did not deal with the proposal to hear two more witnesses. “(1) In the Republic of Hungary, everyone is equal before the law, and has the right to have any criminal charge against him or his civil rights and obligations determined in a fair and public trial by an independent and impartial court established by law. ... (3) Individuals subject to criminal proceedings are entitled to the right of defence at all stages of the proceedings. ...” “(3) The Constitutional Court shall order the review of such criminal proceedings as have been finally concluded under unconstitutional legal provisions if the convicted person has not yet been exempted from the legal effects of the conviction – provided that from the nullity of the provision applied in the procedure, the reduction or non-imposition of the punishment or measure, or the exemption from or reduction of [criminal] liability would follow.” “(1) Any person who claims to have suffered a violation of his rights enshrined in the Constitution on account of the application of an unconstitutional provision and has exhausted all other legal remedies or there are no such remedies available, may submit a constitutional complaint to the Constitutional Court. (2) A constitutional complaint may be filed in writing within 60 days of the service of the legally binding decision.” “(3) An appeal may concern questions of fact or law.” “(2) In order to eliminate the ill-foundedness of the first-instance judgment, evidence may be taken if the findings of fact have not been established or are deficient. Evidence shall be taken ... at a hearing.” “(1) Within 30 days of receiving the file, the president of the panel in charge shall schedule, in order to deal with an appeal, deliberations in camera (tanácsülés), a public session (nyilvános ülés) or a hearing (tárgyalás). ...” “(1) The second-instance court shall hold a public session, if – the first-instance judgment being ill-founded – the complete and/or correct findings of fact may be established from the contents of the file or through drawing factual conclusions, or if the defendant must be heard in order to clarify the circumstances relevant for imposing the sentence. (2) The second-instance court shall summon to the public session those persons whose hearing it deems necessary ...” “(1) The second-instance court shall notify the public prosecutor and – if they are not summoned – ... the defendant and his lawyer of the public session. ...” “(2) In order to take evidence, a hearing ... shall be scheduled.” “(1) Review proceedings may be instituted against a final decision on the merits if: ... e) the Constitutional Court has ordered (elrendelte) the review of criminal proceedings concluded by a final judgment, provided that the defendant has not yet been exempted from the legal consequences flowing from his conviction, or the execution of the imposed punishment ... has not yet been terminated ... or its enforceability has not yet ceased; f) the determination of criminal liability or the imposition of a sanction ... has been effected in application of a criminal law provision, whose unconstitutionality has already been established by the Constitutional Court, but the defendant has already been exempted from the legal consequences flowing from his conviction, or the execution of the punishment has already been terminated or its enforceability has ceased ...” “(1) The Constitutional Court finds that section 360(1) of Act no. XIX of 1998 on the Code of Criminal Procedure is unconstitutional and therefore annuls it as of the date of delivery of this decision. ... (3) The Constitutional Court finds that Parliament has committed an unconstitutional omission by failing to regulate, in Act no. XIX of 1998 on the Code of Criminal Procedure and in accordance with the requirements of legal certainty and fair trial, the scope of those cases in which the appellate court may hold in camera deliberations. The Constitutional Court invites Parliament to comply with its legislative duties by 31 October 2005. (4) The Constitutional Court holds that section 360(1) of Act no. XIX of 1998 on the Code of Criminal Procedure was unconstitutional and therefore this provision cannot be applied in the following cases, concluded by a final judgment (jogerősen befejezett ügyeiben nem alkalmazható): ... nos.

568,568,"The applicant, Mrs Valentina Vsevolodovna Podolskaya, is a Russian national, who was born in 1932 and lives in Orenburg. The respondent Government are represented by Mr P. Laptev, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 16 June 2000 the applicant’s husband, Mr Podolskiy, was presented a book Doctors of the 20th Century (“Доктора ХХ века”) published by the Orenburg health protection department. On reading the book Mr Podolskiy found that his name had been omitted from a chronological list of directors of the Orenburg health protection department, although he had worked in that position from 1966 to 1981. Also, in another place there was a mistake in his initials. Finally, the book contained a photograph of Mr Podolskiy with an unknown woman; the caption of the photograph indicated that the persons on the photograph were “Mr Podolskiy with his spouse”. On 7 August 2000 Mr Podolskiy lodged a civil action against the authors and publishers of the book for the protection of his honour, dignity and professional reputation and compensation for non-pecuniary damage. He also sought an injunction to stop dissemination of the book, recall all printed copies and make necessary corrections. Mr Podolskiy submitted that the omissions in the publication damaged his professional reputation and also “upset the peace” of his family life. He explained that he had been married to his spouse for more than fifty years and they both adhered to “traditional moral values” that included disapproval of divorce and re-marriages. He also stated that because of the publication he had to seek medical assistance in June and July 2000. On 15 May 2001 the Leninskiy District Court of Orenburg gave its judgment. The court found that a mistake in Mr Podolskiy’s initials was a typographical error. It established that Mr Podolskiy’s name had been wrongly omitted from the chronological list and the caption of the picture was indeed incorrect. Nevertheless, the court concluded: “However, the court does not consider that [this information] is damaging, i.e. [that it] contains indications that the plaintiff has committed an offence under existing laws or has transgressed moral principles... Re-marriages are not prohibited by law, not condemned in society and can be entered into because of various reasons.” The court dismissed Mr Podolskiy’s action in full. On 24 May 2001 Mr Podolskiy’s lawyer appealed against the judgment. He argued, in particular, that the damage caused to the plaintiff’s goodwill had to be assessed with regard to the plaintiff’s individual subjective values, such as the conviction that remarriages were unacceptable. On 4 July 2001 Mr Podolskiy died of a heart attack. On the applicant’s request, she was recognised as Mr Podolskiy’s legal successor in the civil proceedings. The court agreed that the applicant also had her own interest in pursuing the claim. On 30 August 2001 the Orenburg Regional Court upheld the judgment of 15 May 2001. The court confirmed that the information in the book was incorrect; however, it did not consider that such information was damaging to Mr Podolskiy’s or the applicant’s dignity, honour or reputation. Article 151 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation of 30 November 1994 provides that a court may award compensation for non-pecuniary damage to an individual who sustained such damage as a result of acts that violated his personal non-pecuniary rights. Article 152 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation provides that an individual may seize a court with a request for retraction of information damaging his or her honour, dignity or professional reputation unless the person who distributed such information proves its accuracy. In addition to retraction, the individual may also claim compensation for losses and non-pecuniary damage sustained as a result of distribution of such information.",0,637
572,572,"4. The applicant was born in in 1947 and lives in Bratislava. 5. On 3 May 1991 the applicant filed an action for damages with the Bratislava I District Court. She claimed compensation for a work-related accident. 6. On 9 September 1993 the District Court dismissed the action. The applicant appealed on 1 October 1993. 7. On 31 August 1994 the Bratislava City Court quashed the first instance judgment. 8. On 31 October 1996 the applicant extended her action in that she also claimed the protection of her right to protection of her reputation. 9. On 31 July 1998 the Bratislava I District Court ordered an expert opinion to be submitted. 10. The applicant filed a petition pursuant to Article 130 (3) of the Constitution in which she complained about the length of the proceedings. On 22 September 1999 the Constitutional Court found that the Bratislava I District Court had violated the applicant’s constitutional right to have her case examined without undue delays. 11. On 18 December 2000 the Bratislava I District Court ordered an expert opinion. Subsequently the applicant unsuccessfully challenged the District Court judge. 12. On 12 August 2002 the District Court decided on the expert’s fees. The applicant appealed against this decision. On 6 September 2002 she submitted to the court her comments on the expert’s conclusions. 13. On 4 March 2003 the District Court invited the parties to submit further information. The proceedings are pending. 14. Article 48 (2) of the Constitution provides, inter alia, that every person has the right to have his or her case tried without unjustified delay. 15. Pursuant to Article 130 (3) of the Constitution, as in force until 30 June 2001, the Constitutional Court could commence proceedings upon the petition (“podnet”) presented by any individual or a corporation claiming that their rights have been violated. 16. According to its case-law under the former Article 130 (3) of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court lacked jurisdiction to draw legal consequences from a violation of a petitioner’s rights under Article 48 (2) of the Constitution. It could neither grant damages to the person concerned nor impose a sanction on the public authority liable for the violation found. In the Constitutional Court’s view, it was therefore for the authority concerned to provide redress to the person whose rights were violated. 17. As from 1 January 2002, the Constitution has been amended in that, inter alia, individuals and legal persons can complain about a violation of their fundamental rights and freedoms pursuant to Article 127. Under this provision the Constitutional Court has the power, in case that it founds a violation of Article 48 (2) of the Constitution, to order the authority concerned to proceed with the case without delay. It may also grant adequate financial satisfaction to the person whose constitutional right was violated as a result of excessive length of proceedings (for further details see, e.g., Andrášik and Others v. Slovakia (dec.), nos. 57984/00, 60237/00, 60242/00, 60679/00, 60680/00, 68563/01, 60226/00, 22 October 2002). 18. According to an explanatory letter by the President of the Constitutional Court of 6 June 2002, nothing has prevented the Constitutional Court from dealing with complaints about length of proceedings in cases in which proceedings have also been instituted before the European Court of Human Rights provided that the domestic proceedings complained of are still pending at the moment when the constitutional complaint is filed. The letter further states that where the Constitutional Court earlier found a violation of Article 48 (2) of the Constitution, a further complaint about delays in the same proceedings can be entertained only to the extent that it relates to the period after the delivery of the first finding of the Constitutional Court. However, when deciding on such cases the Constitutional Court will, as a rule, take into account that the ordinary courts have failed to proceed with the case without undue delays following its finding of a violation of Article 48 (2) of the Constitution.",1,662
577,577,"8. On 25 October 1990 and 9 November 1990 criminal complaints were lodged against the applicant for instigation to fraud and for issuing checks for the payment of which there were no adequate funds. The prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings against him. 9. In 1994 the investigating judge ordered the applicant’s provisional detention (warrant No. 22/94). However, the applicant evaded arrest. 10. On 5 August 1994 the indictments chamber of the first instance criminal court (simvulio plimmeliodikon) of Athens decided to commit the applicant for trial to the three-member Court of Appeal (trimeles efetio) of Athens, sitting as a first instance court, on the above charges. The chamber confirmed the investigating judge’s warrant concerning the applicant’s detention. 11. On 2 February 1995 the indictments chamber decided to commit the applicant for trial on a number of supplementary charges. 12. The applicant was arrested on 2 September 1995. Until 30 October 1995 the applicant was deemed to be serving a sentence that had been imposed on him for unrelated offences in 1989. As a result, the applicant’s detention on remand on the fraud and other charges mentioned above officially started on 30 October 1995. 13. On 17 July 1996 the applicant applied for his provisional release. On 22 August 1996 the indictments chamber of the Court of Appeal of Athens rejected his application. 14. On 2 September 1996 the applicant appeared, together with MB, JK and DK, before the three-member Court of Appeal of Athens. He was represented by counsel who also acted for MB and JK. The trial lasted until 3 September 1996 when the court heard the final submissions of the parties on the question of guilt of the applicant and his co-defendants. Then the court withdrew for deliberations in the course of which it decided to acquit the applicant and convict MB and JK. 15. The relevant decision was pronounced and then the court heard submissions on the sentences to be imposed on MB and JK. Counsel who represented the applicant as well as MB and JK was heard in this connection. The court withdrew for deliberations in the course of which it decided on the penalties to be imposed. It also decided that “the applicant should not be compensated for the time he spent in detention on remand”. The relevant decision was pronounced on the same day, i.e. on 3 September 1996. 16. However, its text was finalised (katharographi) on 9 December 1996. The applicant was informed of this development later on and obtained a certified copy on 28 July 1997. 17. The Code of Criminal Procedure provides as follows: “Persons who have been detained on remand and subsequently acquitted ... have the right to request compensation ..., if it has been established in the proceedings that they did not commit the criminal offence for which they have been detained on remand.” “The State does not have any obligation to compensate a person who ... has been detained on remand if the latter, intentionally or by gross negligence, was responsible for his own detention.” “Upon an application submitted orally by the person who has been acquitted, the court which heard the case shall decide on the State's obligation to pay compensation in a separate decision issued at the same time as the verdict. However, the court may also issue such a decision proprio motu ... The decision regarding the obligation of the State to pay compensation cannot be challenged separately; it is, however, quashed when the decision on the principal issue of the criminal trial is reversed.” “The person who has suffered prejudice may request compensation at a later stage before the same court. In these circumstances, the application must be submitted to the public prosecutor of this court strictly within forty-eight hours from the pronouncement of the judgment in open court.” “After it has been decided that the State must pay compensation, the person entitled thereto may bring his claim before the civil courts, which may not re-examine the existence of the State's obligation.” “Persons who have been unfairly ... detained on remand must be compensated for any material prejudice they have suffered as a result of their ... detention. They must also be compensated for moral damage ... .”",1,703
578,578,"8. The applicant company is owned by Mr Smail Smailagić who lived in Banja Luka, which is situated on the territory of the present day Republika Srpska, a part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, until 15 May 1992 when he fled to Croatia and went to live in Porat-Červar. 9. On 13 August 1992 the Croatian Military Police requisitioned a vehicle belonging to the applicant company. 10. According to the Government the vehicle had been requisitioned by the military authorities from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Upon the request by the military authorities from Bosnia and Herzegovina for the return of vehicles which had been requisitioned in Bosnia and Herzegovina for military purposes, in case that they were located in Croatia, the Croatian Ministry of Defence conferred the applicant company's vehicle after having found it. The vehicle was conferred to the Bosnian authorities on 19 August 1993 and has ever since been in their possession. 11. According to the applicant the vehicle was requisitioned by the Croatian authorities and conferred to the Croatian para-military forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the so-called Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeće obrane). The applicant company repeatedly requested the Croatian Defence Council to return the vehicle, but to no avail. 12. On 11 October 1993 the applicant company filed a civil claim for damages in the amount of 15,600 German Marks (DEM) against the Republic of Croatia, with the Zagreb County Commercial Court (Okružni privredni sud u Zagrebu). It appears that the case was subsequently transferred to the Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu). 13. On 15 May 1995 the Republic of Croatia filed its reply denying the plaintiff's claim. It requested the court to stay the proceedings until the end of war in Croatia. It stated further that the vehicle had been requisitioned only temporarily for needs of the army and would be returned to the applicant company after the war. 14. At the hearing on 14 September 1995 the applicant company specified the claim for damages seeking 58,000 Croatian Kunas (HRK). 15. On 12 March 1998 the applicant company requested the Ministry of Justice to speed up the proceedings. 16. On 13 July 1998 the court decided that an expertise be carried out in order to establish the value of the vehicle in question. The applicant company was invited to pay an advance for the costs of the expertise. 17. On 31 August 1998 the case-file was assigned to an expert who submitted his opinion on 5 October 1998. 18. It appears that the defendant asked the court to stay the proceedings claiming that it was uncertain whether the applicant company still existed because the excerpt from the Banja Luka Court registry on the applicant company's legal status was quite old. 19. On 4 May 1999 the court invited the company's representative to submit a new excerpt from the relevant registry. 20. The applicant company's legal representative informed the court that he no longer represented the applicant. 21. On 5 July 1999 the applicant company requested the court to schedule a hearing. 22. On 19 July 1999 the applicant company's representative submitted an uncertified excerpt from the Banja Luka Court's registry dating from 1990. 23. On 25 August 1999 the court invited the applicant to submit a new excerpt, not older than six months, showing that Mr Smailagić was entitled to represent the applicant company. 24. On 6 November 1999 Parliament introduced a change of the Civil Obligations Act which provided that all proceedings concerning actions for damages resulting from acts of members of the Croatian army or police when acting in their official capacity during the war in Croatia were to be stayed. 25. On 10 December 1999 the court stayed the proceedings pursuant to the above change in law. 26. On 29 December 1999 the applicant company appealed against the above decision claiming that the Zagreb Municipal Court erred in its application of the law as the vehicle in question was not taken by any member of the Croatian army or police acting in an official capacity but exclusively for the needs of the Croatian Defence Council, a military formation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, operating in that country. 27. It appears that on 15 November 2000 a party in some other proceedings concerning the same matter filed a constitutional claim challenging the above legislation. However, the Constitutional Court has not yet adopted any decision. 28. On 8 May 2001 the Zagreb County Court (Županijski sud u Zagrebu) upheld the Zagreb Municipal Court decision of 10 December 1999. 29. On 16 June 2001 the applicant company filed a request for revision with the Zagreb Municipal Court, repeating its arguments from the earlier appeal. On 28 June 2001 the Zagreb Municipal Court rejected the above request as inadmissible. It found that the Civil Procedure Act (Zakon o parničnom postupku) allows a party to file a request for revision only against a final decision of an appellate court while the decision of the Zagreb County Court did not represent a final decision in that case. 30. On 21 July 2001 the applicant company appealed against the Municipal Court's decision. 31. On 2 October the Zagreb County Court dismissed the appeal. 32. Section 184 (a) of the 1999 Act on Changes of the Civil Obligations Act (Zakon o dopunama Zakonu o obveznim odnosima, Official Gazette no. 112/1999) provides that all proceedings instituted against the Republic of Croatia for damages caused by the members of the Croatian army or police when acting in their official capacity during the Homeland War in Croatia from 7 August 1990 to 30 June 1996 are to be stayed. 33. The Act also imposed an obligation on the Government to submit to Parliament special legislation, regulating the responsibility for such damages, at the latest within six months from the entry into force of the present Act. So far no new legislation has been introduced.",1,980

In the context of complications suffered from plastic surgery, on 13 February 1992 the applicant brought an action in compensation against a hospital. 6. After having held several hearings and obtained the opinion of an expert, on 11 October 1994 the Pest Central District Court gave an interim judgment, accepting the applicant’s entitlement to compensation. On appeal, on 7 November 1995 the Budapest Regional Court upheld this decision. 7. Subsequently the proceedings continued before the District Court. In January 1996 the applicant extended her claims. After having held several hearings and obtained an expert opinion, on 27 January 2000 the District Court partly found for the applicant. On 24 January 2001 the Regional Court amended this decision. 8. On 25 June 2003 the Supreme Court quashed these decisions and remitted the case to the first-instance court. 9. After several hearings in the resumed first-instance proceedings, on 31 October 2006 the District Court ordered the respondent to pay the applicant 1.9 million Hungarian forints (HUF) in compensation plus accrued interest, together with a monthly allowance in arrears and pro futuro. 10. On 19 February 2008 the Regional Court upheld this judgment. 11. On 6 May 2008 the first-instance judgment was rectified.",1,212

The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 21 August 1999 the Tsentralno-Gorodskoy District Court of Gorlovka awarded the applicant 1,438 Ukrainian hryvnias in compensation for damage caused to his property by a privately owned company, “Z.”. That judgment became final and the State Bailiffs’ Service instituted proceedings to enforce it. On 10 June 2003 the Donetsk Commercial Court instituted liquidation proceedings against the debtor company. In this regard on 4 November 2003 the State Bailiffs’ Service terminated the enforcement proceedings against the debtor company and transferred the applicant’s writ of enforcement to the liquidation commission for further processing. The applicant complained to various State authorities about lengthy non-enforcement of the judgment in his favour, but to no avail. However, he did not sue the State Bailiffs’ Service for its alleged inactivity or omissions. The judgment of 21 August 1999 remains unenforced. The relevant provisions of the State Bailiffs’ Service Act of 24 March 1998 and the Enforcement Proceedings Act of 21 April 1999 are summarised in the case of Dzizin v.

582,582,"The applicants, Mrs Maria Mazurek and Mr Tadeusz Mazurek, are Polish nationals who were born in 1932 and 1927 respectively. They live in Rumia, Poland. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicants shared an apartment with a certain married couple, J.K. and U.K. On 2 November 1992 the applicants requested the Gdynia District Court (Sad Rejonowy) to order eviction of J.K. and U.K. (“the defendants”) from the apartment. They claimed that the defendants had no legal title to occupy the premises. On 2 February 1993 the Gdynia District Court gave judgment, in which it ordered eviction of the defendants from the applicants’ apartment. The judgment became final. On 27 April 1993 the District Court issued a writ of enforcement. The case was transferred to the Rumia Municipal Office (Urzad Miasta Rumia) which was charged with enforcement of the judgment by providing the defendants with an alternative dwelling (lokal zastepczy). On 15 January 1997 the applicants lodged with the Gdańsk Governor (Wojewoda) a complaint about the inactivity of the Rumia Municipal Office. The complaint was transferred to the Gdańsk SelfGovernment Board, which ordered the Rumia Municipal Office to submit the applicants’ casefile. Subsequently, the Rumia Municipal Office informed the Gdańsk Self-Government Board that no decision had yet been made in the case. Following several complaints made by the applicants to the Municipal Office, the MPs and the Ombudsman, on 19 May 1999 the Rumia Mayor informed them that it was not possible to give an exact date when the proceedings would end because the municipality did not have available a sufficient number of alternative dwellings. On 3 January 2001 the applicants turned to the Pomorskie Governor complaining about the inactivity of the administrative authorities. On 5 January 2001 the Pomorskie Governor requested the Rumia Mayor to deal with the case as soon as possible. On 20 February 2001 the Rumia Mayor provided the defendants with an alternative dwelling. According to the Law of 2 July 1994 on the Lease of Dwellings and Housing Allowances (Ustawa o najmie lokali mieszkalnych i dodatkach mieszkaniowych), enforcement of a final court’s judgment concerning the provision of an alternative dwelling should be dealt by the municipalities in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Administrative Procedure. Article 35 of the Code of Administrative Procedure lays down timelimits ranging from 1 month to 2 months for dealing with a case pending before an administrative authority. If those time-limits have not been complied with, the authority must, under Article 36 of the Code, inform the parties of that fact, explain the reasons for the delay and fix a new timelimit. Pursuant to Article 37 § 1, if the case has not been handled within the time-limits referred to in Articles 35 and 36, a party to administrative proceedings can lodge an appeal to the higher authority, alleging inactivity. In cases where the allegations of inactivity are well-founded, the higher authority fixes a new term for handling the case and orders an inquiry in order to determine the reasons for the inactivity and to identify the persons responsible for the delay. If need be, the authority may order that measures be applied to prevent future such delays. Until 1 October 1995, under Article 216 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, a party to administrative proceedings could, at any time, lodge with the Supreme Administrative Court a complaint about the fact that an administrative authority had failed to issue a decision. On 1 October 1995, when a new Law of 11 May 1995 on the Supreme Administrative Court (“the 1995 Act”) took effect, Article 216 of the Code of Administrative Procedure was repealed. Under section 17 of the 1995 Act, a party to administrative proceedings may, at any time, lodge with the Supreme Administrative Court a complaint against inactivity on the part of an authority obliged to issue an administrative decision. Section 26 of the Law provides: “When a complaint alleging inactivity on the part of an administrative authority is well-founded, the Supreme Administrative Court shall oblige that authority to issue a decision, or to perform a specific act, or to confirm, declare, or recognise a right or obligation provided for by law.” Moreover, the Court notes that pursuant to section 30 of the Law, the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court ordering an authority to put an end to its inactivity is legally binding on the authority concerned. If the authority has not complied with the decision, the court may, under section 31 of the 1995 Act, impose a fine on it and may itself give a ruling on the right or obligation in question. Pursuant to section 31 of the Law, a party to the proceedings who sustains damage as a result of a failure of the administrative body to act in compliance with the judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court given under Article 17 of the Act, is entitled to claim compensation from the administrative authority concerned, according to principles of civil liability as set out in the Civil Code. Such a claim should be first lodged with that authority. A decision on the compensation claim should be taken by that administrative authority within three months. If the authority concerned fails to give a ruling in this respect within this timelimit, or if the party is not satisfied with the compensation granted, a compensation claim against the administrative body can be lodged with a civil court. Section 34 of the 1995 Act sets out the requirement of the exhaustion of available remedies before lodging a complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court. Accordingly, a complaint concerning alleged inactivity should be preceded by the lodging of a complaint with an administrative organ of a higher level, pursuant to the abovementioned Article 37 of the Code of Administrative Procedure.",0,970
587,587,"The applicant, Mr Ramazan Şimşek, is a Turkish national, who was born in 1976 and lives in Batman. He is represented before the Court by Ms Y. Dora Şeker, a lawyer practising in Adana. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 23 October 1995 the applicant was arrested by police officers from the anti-terrorist branch of the Izmir Security Directorate on suspicion of his involvement in the PKK. On 6 November 1995 the applicant was brought before the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, who remanded the applicant in custody. On 20 November 1995 the public prosecutor at the Konya State Security Court filed an indictment with the same court accusing the applicant of being a member of the PKK. On 19 May 1997, after the promulgation of Law No. 4210, which abolished the Konya State Security Court, the case file was transferred to the Adana State Security Court. The criminal proceedings at the Adana State Security Court began on 11 June 1997. On 16 June 1998 the Adana State Security Court convicted the applicant of the offence as charged and sentenced him to the death penalty. It then commuted this to life imprisonment. On 6 May 1999 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the State Security Court on account of “the lack of a final investigation” and remitted the case file back to the latter. The criminal proceedings at the Adana State Security Court began on 24 August 1999. On 23 November 1999 the court convicted the applicant of the same offence and issued the same sentence. On 27 September 2000 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first instance court and remitted the case to the Adana State Security Court. On 15 March 2001, the Adana State Security Court, after having complied with the requirement of the Court of Cassation, sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment. On 27 September 2001 the Court of Cassation upheld the latter judgment. The applicant was notified of this judgment on 9 April 2002.",0,344
588,588,"The applicant, the Rijeka Serbian Orthodox Church (Srpska Pravoslavna Crkvena Opština na Rijeci), is a religious community with its seat in Rijeka. It is represented before the Court by Mr M. Markiš, a lawyer practising in Rijeka. The respondent Government are represented by their Agents, first Ms L. Lukina-Karajković and subsequently Ms Š. Stažnik. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant owns in Rijeka a flat of a surface of 104.57 square metres. A certain Ž.J. had a specially protected tenancy of the flat. On 22 October 1996 Parliament enacted the Lease Act, which regulates the conditions of leasing privately-owned flats, including those previously let under a specially protected tenancy. Under the Lease Act, on 8 November 1997 the applicant let the flat to Ž.J. On 1 April 1999 the applicant terminated the lease because it intended to lodge a priest in the flat. Since Ž.J refused to vacate the flat, the applicant instituted proceedings in the Rijeka Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Rijeci) seeking eviction of Ž.J. The applicant based its claim on the Lease Act claiming that it needed the flat for its own use, namely to house its priest. It also claimed that it could provide for Ž.J. another flat also situated in Rijeka, but a smaller one, of a surface of 48 square metres. On 5 June 2000 the Rijeka Municipal Court dismissed the applicant’s action, finding that it did not need the flat in question for itself but only to install its priest. The court found that the priest could have lived in any other flat including the one that the applicant was offering to Ž.J. The applicant appealed against the first-instance judgment arguing that installing its priest in the flat at issue amounted to the use of the flat by the applicant itself. On 4 April 2001 the Rijeka County Court (Županijski sud u Rijeci) dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It found that the applicant did not satisfy the conditions of section 40 of the Lease Act because it was a legal entity rather than a natural person. The court stated that the question whether there existed a need for the flat at issue on behalf of the applicant, the reasons for eviction of Ž.J., and the fact that the applicant had offered Ž.J. another flat, were irrelevant in the present case. The applicant subsequently filed a constitutional complaint claiming, inter alia, that its property rights were violated because it had no possibility to terminate the lease on the flat that it owned. On 3 June 2002 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) dismissed the applicant’s complaint. It found that the lower courts’ decisions were based on law, and that the relevant provisions of the Lease Act providing for termination of a lease for personal reasons referred only to natural persons but not to legal entities. It stated that the applicant’s inability to terminate the lease did not violate its property rights. Meanwhile, Ž.J. died, but his wife, A.J., continues to live in the flat. The Flat Lease Act (Zakon o najmu stanova, Official Gazette no. 91/1996 of 28 October 1996) (“the Lease Act”) regulates the legal relationship between the landlord and the tenant with respect to the lease of flats. It recognises a special category of tenants, namely those who were previously holders of specially protected tenancies on privately-owned flats. Such a category is, according to the Act, subject to a number of protections, for instance, an obligation for the owners to contract a lease for an unlimited period of time; payment of a so-called protected rent, the amount of which is to be prescribed by the Government, as well as limited reasons for the termination of the lease. The Lease Act abolished the specially protected tenancy as such. Pursuant to the Lease Act a landlord may terminate the lease of a protected tenant in the following cases: if the tenant does not pay the rent or charges; if the tenant sublets the flat or part of it, without permission from the landlord; if the tenant or other tenants in the flat disturb other tenants in the building; if another person, not figuring in the lease contract, lives in the flat longer than thirty days, without permission from the landlord, except where that person is a spouse, child or parent of the tenant or of the other legal tenants in the flat, or a dependant of the tenant or a person on whom the tenant is dependent; if the tenant or other legal tenants do not use the flat for living, but for other purposes; if the landlord does not have another flat and is entitled to social assistance benefits or is older than sixty years. Under section 40 (1) of the Lease Act, the landlord may also terminate a lease of a protected tenant if the landlord intends to move into the flat himself or install his children, parents or dependants therein.",0,830
589,589,"5. The applicants were born in 1923, 1948 and 1952 respectively and live in Istanbul. 6. The first applicant is the mother and the remaining two applicants are the sister and brother of Ms Nilgün Hasefe, who was employed by Sabancı Holdings in Istanbul. On 9 January 1996 a number of armed persons raided the Holdings' premises and killed Nilgün Hasefe and two others. 7. On 11 November 1996 the applicants wrote to the Ministry of the Interior (“the Ministry”) and claimed compensation in accordance with Article 125 of the Constitution on the ground of the State's failure to protect Nilgün Hasefe's right to life. The Ministry rejected the claim on 9 December 1996. 8. On 14 February 1997 the applicants filed a compensation claim against the Ministry before the Istanbul Administrative Court (hereafter “the Istanbul court”). 9. On 14 October 1999 the Istanbul court partly allowed their claims for compensation and ordered the Ministry to pay certain sums of compensation to the applicants in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. 10. On 9 March 2000 the applicants asked the Ministry to pay them the amounts of compensation awarded by the Istanbul court. 11. The Ministry appealed against the decision on 22 March 2000 and asked for an interim injunction suspending the execution of the Istanbul court's decision. In his written submissions the prosecutor at the Supreme Administrative Court agreed with the Ministry and requested that an interim injunction be granted and that the decision of the Istanbul court be quashed. The prosecutor's written submissions were not forwarded to the applicants. 12. On 18 May 2000 the Supreme Administrative Court granted the injunction sought by the Ministry and on 6 March 2002 it quashed the Istanbul court's decision of 14 October 1999. 13. The case was remitted to the Istanbul court, which decided on 31 January 2003 to reach the same conclusion as it had in its decision of 14 October 1999. It ordered the Ministry to pay the same amounts of compensation to the applicants as those awarded in its previous decision. The Ministry appealed. The applicants also appealed and argued that the amounts of compensation ordered by the Istanbul court were no longer satisfactory owing to the low rates of interest. 14. On 14 April 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court's General Council of the Administrative Chambers (Danıştay İdari Dava Daireleri Genel Kurulu) dismissed the Ministry's appeal and accepted the applicants' claims for higher rates of interest in respect of non-pecuniary damage. 15. A request by the Ministry for rectification of the Istanbul court's decision of 31 January 2003 was rejected on 16 March 2006. 16. On 31 October 2006 the Istanbul court adopted a decision in line with the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court's General Council of the Administrative Chambers in so far as it concerned the rates of interest for non-pecuniary damage, and awarded compensation to the applicants. On 2 March 2007 the Ministry appealed against the decision. According to the information provided by the Government, the appeal proceedings are still pending. 17. On 10 December 2007 the Ministry paid the applicants the amounts of compensation awarded by the Istanbul court in its decision of 14 October 1999 and the interest awarded in the same court's decision of 31 October 2006. The total sum paid to the three applicants was 63,080 new Turkish liras (TRY – approximately 37,000 euros (EUR) at the time). 18. Article 13 of the Code of Administrative Procedure provides that anyone who has suffered damage as a result of an act committed by the administrative authorities may claim compensation from the authorities within one year of the alleged act. The victim must first apply to the relevant administrative entity and claim compensation for the damage before he or she can lodge a compensation claim in the administrative courts. If this claim is dismissed in whole or in part or if no reply is received within sixty days, the victim may bring administrative proceedings. 19. Article 28 of the Code of Administrative Procedure provides: “(1) The authorities shall be obliged to adopt a decision without delay or to take action in accordance with the decisions on the merits or a request for a stay of execution issued by the Supreme Administrative Court, the ordinary or regional administrative courts or the courts dealing with tax disputes. Under no circumstances may the time taken to act exceed thirty days following service of the decision on the authorities. ... (3) Where the authorities do not adopt a decision or do not act in accordance with a decision by the Supreme Administrative Court, the ordinary or regional administrative courts or the tax courts, a claim for compensation for pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage may be brought before the Supreme Administrative Court and the relevant courts against the authorities. (4) In the event of deliberate failure on the part of civil servants to enforce judicial decisions within the thirty days [following the decision], compensation proceedings may be brought both against the authorities and against the civil servant who refuses to enforce the decision in question.”",1,846
590,590,"The applicants, Ms Marie-Jeanne Boicescu, Mr Vlad Boicescu and Mr Şerban Ion Boicescu are Romanian nationals who were born in 1937, 1945 and 1953, respectively, in Craiova and live in Bucharest. They were represented before the Court by Mr Dan Mihai, a lawyer practising in Bucharest. On unspecified dates the applicants filed two administrative applications with the Dolj County Commission for the Implementation of Law No. 112 of 1995 (the Commission) seeking the restitution in natura of the immovable property located at no. 82 Unirii St. in Craiova and nationalised by the State on the basis of the provisions of Law-Decree No. 92 of 1950. By two decisions of 20 March and 8 May 1997 the Commission rejected the applicants' claim seeking the restitution in natura of the immovable property, on the ground that it was occupied by tenants, and acknowledged their right to compensation under the procedure provided for by Law No. 112 of 1995. On 29 July 1997 the applicants brought an action against the Commission seeking the recovery of possession of the claimed immovable property. On 8 January 1998 the Commission valued the immovable property to be worth 412,041,096 lei (ROL), capped the amount in accordance with Article 13 § 2 of Law No. 112 of 1995 and awarded the applicants the total sum of ROL 170,458,080 in compensation. By a decision of 28 October 1998 the Craiova District Court rejected the applicants' action seeking the recovery of possession of the claimed immovable property. It held that by pursuing the procedure provided for by Law No. 112 of 1995 the applicants had acknowledged that the immovable property had been nationalised legally by the State. Therefore, they could no longer bring court proceedings seeking the recovery of possession of their property, as the legal bases of the two sets of proceedings were different and irreconcilable. The applicants appealed the decision. By a decision of 20 April 2000 the Dolj County Court allowed the applicants' appeal and quashed the decision of 28 October 1998 on the ground that the claimed immovable property had been nationalised illegally by the State. The court also ordered the restitution in natura of the immovable property to the applicants. The Commission appealed the decision. By a final decision of 10 November 2000 the Craiova Court of Appeal allowed the Commission's appeal (recurs) and upheld the decision of 28 October 1998 on the ground that the administrative decisions acknowledging the lawfulness of the nationalisation had not been contested by the applicants, the said administrative decisions remained final and therefore the applicants could no longer institute proceedings seeking the recovery of possession of the claimed immovable property. In a letter of 12 September 2001 the applicants informed the Court that they refused to collect the compensation awarded to them on the basis of Law No. 112 of 1995 on the ground that the compensation awarded did not reflect the market value of the property. There is no evidence in the file that the applicants filed administrative applications or instituted court proceedings under the procedure provided for by the restitution laws (Laws Nos. 10 of 2001, 247 of 2005 and 1 of 2009) seeking restitution in natura or compensation equivalent to the market value of the claimed immovable property. In a letter of 10 February 2010, delivered to the applicants on 15 February 2010, they were asked to inform the Court if they had filed administrative applications or instituted court proceedings under the procedure provided for by the restitution laws. The letter remains unanswered to date. a) The relevant domestic legal provisions concerning excerpts from Law Decree No. 92/1950 regulating the nationalisation of immovable property and excerpts from Law No. 112/1995 regulating the legal status of immovable property nationalised for apartment building use are summarised in Constantinescu v. Romania ((dec.), no. 61767/00, 14 September 2004). b) The relevant provisions of Law No. 10/2001 of 14 February 2001 regulating the legal status of immovable property unlawfully nationalised by the State between 6 March 1945 and 22 December 1989, as it was amended by Law No. 247/2005, are summarised in Halmagiu and Belu v. Romania (no. 10012/03, §§ 18-20, 3 June 2008). c) The relevant provisions of Law No. 1/2009 of 30 January 2009 amending Law No. 10/2001 regulating the legal status of immovable property unlawfully nationalised by the State between 6 March 1945 and 22 December 1989, which entered force on 6 February 2009, read as follows: “(1). Individuals who were compensated under the procedure provided for by the provisions of Law No. 112 of 1995, (...), could claim the restitution in natura of the claimed immovable property insofar as the property had not been sold by the time of the entry into force of the law and insofar as they had returned the amount received as compensation, (...). (2). Where the immovable property was sold in compliance with the provisions of Law No. 112 of 1995, (...), the entitled individuals have a right to equivalent compensatory measures which reflect the market value of the immovable property (...). Where the entitled individuals were awarded compensation on the basis of the procedure provided for by Law No. 112 of 1995, (...), they have a right to be awarded the difference in value between the sums they had cashed in and the market value of the immovable property (...).”",0,889
593,593,"4. The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in Benevento. 5. On 5 May 1987 Mr F. asked the Benevento District Court to order the applicant to pay him 73,934,495 Italian lire (38,183.98 euros (EUR)) for professional services. On 11 May 1987 the President of the Benevento District Court granted the application. The order was served on the applicant on 20 May 1987. 6. On 8 June 1987 the applicant challenged the order in the Benevento District Court. Preparation of the case for trial began on 24 September 1987. Of the twenty-nine hearings listed between 26 November 1987 and 16 October 1998 seven were adjourned by the court of its own motion, ten were devoted to organising expert evidence and supplementary findings and two were adjourned at the parties' request. 7. On 16 April 1999 the case was referred to the sezioni stralcio. Of the four hearings listed between 22 September 1999 and 8 February 2002 one was adjourned because the parties had not appeared and one was adjourned by the court of its own motion. 8. On 10 January 2002 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Rome Court of Appeal under Law no. 89 of 24 March 2001, known as the “Pinto” Act, complaining of the excessive length of the above-described proceedings. The applicant asked the court to rule that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and to order the Italian Government to pay compensation for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage sustained. The applicant claimed, inter alia, EUR 14,460.94 in pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages. 9. In a decision of 21 June 2002, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 2 October 2002, the Court of Appeal found that a reasonable time had been exceeded. It dismissed the claim for pecuniary damages on the ground that the applicant had not provided any proof, awarded him EUR 2,000 on an equitable basis in compensation for non-pecuniary damage, EUR 700 for costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights and EUR 900 for the costs and expenses incurred in the Pinto proceedings. 10. That decision was served on the authorities on 23 January 2003 and became binding on 24 March 2003. The applicant served the authorities with notice to comply on 15 October 2003. On 29 October 2003 the applicant lodged an application for seizure with the Rome judge responsible for enforcement proceedings and a hearing was to be held on 28 March 2004. 11. In a letter of 21 January 2003 the applicant informed the Court of the outcome of the domestic proceedings and asked it to resume its examination of his application. 12. The applicant did not indicate that he had appealed to the Court of Cassation.",1,465
595,595,"4. The applicant was born in 1920 and lives in Katowice, Poland. 5. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 6. Since 1965, the applicant’s relatives, Z.D. and L.D, have occupied a part of the applicant’s property, with the agreement of the applicant. It appears that Z.D. and L.D. carried out construction work on the property which provoked a conflict between them and the applicant. 7. On 4 January 1994 the applicant lodged a civil action with the Katowice District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) in which he asked the court to order the eviction of Z.D. and L.D from his property. 8. On 31 January 1994 the trial court held a hearing at which it gave a default judgment (wyrok zaoczny). The court allowed the applicant’s action and ordered that the judgement be immediately enforceable. 9. The defendants lodged an objection against the judgment. 10. On 7 March 1994 the Katowice District Court held a hearing at which it allowed the applicant’s motions to hear witnesses and to hold a viewing of the property. Subsequently, the trial court requested a copy of the casefile concerning another set of civil proceedings instituted by the defendants against the applicant. 11. On 27 April 1994 the court decided to stay the proceedings until the termination of the second set of proceedings, instituted by the defendants, in which they claimed that they had acquired the title to the property in question by prescription (stwierdzenie nabycia własności poprzez zasiedzenie). 12. The applicant appealed against the decision to stay the proceedings; however, on 6 July 1994 the Katowice Regional Court dismissed his appeal. 13. Subsequently on several occasions, the applicant applied to resume the proceedings. 14. In August 1994, February 1995, February, June, October and December 1996 and May 1997 the trial court requested the Second Division of the Katowice District Court to provide information concerning the state of the proceedings concerning the acquisition of property by prescription. 15. On 10 October 1997 the applicant applied to resume the proceedings. He submitted that the second set of proceedings for acquisitive prescription had ended on 24 September 1997 with the secondinstance court’s decision. 16. On 15 October 1997 the Katowice District Court allowed his application and resumed the proceedings. 17. At the hearing held on 9 December 1997 the defendants informed the court that the second set of proceedings was still pending because they had lodged a cassation appeal. Consequently, on 12 January 1998, the District Court again decided to stay the proceedings. 18. The applicant appealed against this decision, but on 23 March 1998 his appeal was rejected as he had failed to pay the fees for the appeal. 19. Subsequently, the applicant applied to the court to issue a writ of enforcement of the default judgment of 31 January 1994. On 22 May 1998 the Katowice District Court dismissed his application on the grounds that the proceedings were stayed. 20. The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision. 21. On 8 October 1998 the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) quashed the decision of 22 May 1998 and remitted the application concerning the writ of enforcement for reconsideration. 22. On 11 January 1999 the applicant applied to resume the proceedings. He submitted that the second set of the proceedings had ended with the Supreme Court’s decision of 14 October 1998. 23. On 12 January 1999 the court allowed the application and resumed the proceedings. 24. On 26 February 1999 the Katowice District Court held a hearing and gave judgment. It upheld the default judgment of 31 January 1994 and suspended the enforcement order. 25. The defendants lodged an appeal against the judgment with the Katowice Regional Court. 26. On 17 December 1999 the appellate court stayed the proceedings because the defendants had instituted yet another set of proceedings against the applicant. They sought a judgment stipulating that the applicant was obliged to make a declaration of will (oswiadczenie woli) in the form of a consent to the sale of the property in question. The Regional Court found that the proceedings for eviction should be stayed as the determination of the case depended on the outcome of this third set of proceedings. 27. In March 2001 the applicant applied to resume the proceedings. 28. Several times in 2001 and 2002 the trial court requested information regarding the state of the third set of proceedings. Apparently, they were still pending at the time. 29. On 6 March 2003 the Katowice Regional Court was informed that the third set of proceedings had ended. As a result, on 10 March 2003, the court resumed the eviction proceedings. 30. On 10 March 2003 the court held a hearing at which it appointed a lawyer under the legal aid scheme for the defendants. 31. On 28 August 2003 the Katowice Regional Court gave judgment in which it dismissed the defendants’ appeal. 32. It appears that subsequently the defendants tried to re-open the proceedings. 33. Under Sections 173 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure the court may stay civil proceedings either ex officio or at the parties’ request. 34. Section 177 § 1 of the Code, in so far as relevant, provides: “1. The court shall ex officio stay the proceedings: 1) if the determination of the case depends on the outcome of other pending civil proceedings;” 35. Section 180 para. 1 of the Code, insofar as relevant, provides: “1. The court shall ex officio resume the proceedings if the reason for staying them has ceased to exist, in particular when: 4) a final decision has been given in the proceedings on whose outcome the determination of the claim depends; however, if it is justified, the court may resume the proceedings before [any such decision is taken].”",1,963
597,597,"5. The applicants were born in 1971, 1962, 1966 and 1965 respectively. The second applicant is currently detained in Plovdiv Prison. The third applicant lives in Nicosia, Cyprus. The remaining applicants live in the village of Stryama in Bulgaria. 6. On 6 and 12 May 1992 the police in Rakovski opened two investigations into several thefts of sheep and goats. Between 13 and 19 May 1992 the applicants submitted written explanations admitting to having committed the thefts. 7. The proceedings remained dormant until January 2002 when a police investigator questioned several witnesses and commissioned two expert reports concerning the value of the stolen animals. Between 21 and 24 January 2002 the investigator brought charges against the four applicants. 8. On 15 March 2002 the first and third applicants were questioned before a judge. 9. In November 2003 the investigation was concluded and on 8 December 2003 the applicants were indicted for theft. On 1 June 2004 they entered into a plea agreement with the prosecution, accepting short suspended sentences. At a hearing held on the same day the Plovdiv District Court affirmed the agreement and discontinued the proceedings. Its decision was final.",1,192
598,598,"4. The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Bratislava. 5. On 7 November 1997 enforcement proceedings were initiated against the applicant. 6. On 21 January 1999 the Bratislava IV District Court dismissed the applicant's objections against the enforcement and its costs. 7. On 31 January 2000 the district court dismissed the applicant's request for adjournment of the enforcement. On 30 June 2000 the decision was upheld by the Bratislava Regional Court. 8. On 29 January 2001 the applicant requested the district court to issue an interim measure and to discontinue the enforcement. 9. On 21 May 2001 the district court adjourned the enforcement pending its decision on the applicant's request for the enforcement to be discontinued. On 30 November 2001 the regional court quashed the above decision. 10. On 29 October 2003 the applicant again requested discontinuation of the enforcement proceedings. 11. On 25 October 2007 the district court rejected the applicant's request for interim measures. 12. On 17 March 2009 the district court dismissed the applicant's request for discontinuation of the proceedings. 13. On 28 January 2010 the regional court, on the applicant's appeal, quashed the first-instance decision and remitted the case to the district court for further examination. 14. On 20 May 2010 the district court discontinued the proceedings and held that it would deliver a decision on costs once the decision to discontinue the proceedings became final. 15. On 24 June 2010 the applicant's representative informed the Court that the decision has not yet become final. 16. On 6 October 2003 the applicant complained to the Constitutional Court about length of the proceedings before the Bratislava IV District Court and claimed the equivalent of 2,426 euros (EUR) at that time as just satisfaction for non-pecuniary damage suffered. 17. The Constitutional Court examined the period of the proceedings after 29 January 2001. 18. On 2 February 2005 it found that the district court had violated the applicant's right to a hearing without unjustified delay, ordered the latter to avoid further delays and to reimburse the applicant's legal costs. 19. It concluded that these represented a sufficient just satisfaction and did not award the applicant any award for non-pecuniary damage. It referred to the fact that the applicant was the liable party in the proceedings. It further held that the applicant had failed to specify the allegedly suffered harm.",1,392
602,602,"The applicant, Mr Krzysztof Długiewicz, is a Polish national who was born in 1969 and lives in Helmstedt, Germany. He was represented before the Court by Mr J. Angermann, a lawyer practising in Helmstedt, Germany. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 21 May 2004 the applicant was arrested by the police. On 22 May 2004 the Gdańsk District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) decided to detain the applicant on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had smuggled into Poland a large quantity of an illegal substance used for the production of amphetamines. The court held that his detention was necessary to secure the proper course of the proceedings as there was a fear that the applicant would attempt to influence witnesses or evade his trial since he lived in Germany. On 14 June 2004 the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) dismissed an appeal by the applicant against the decision to detain him. On 13 August and 17 November 2004 the District Court further extended the applicant’s detention. In the latter decision the court relied on the likelihood that a heavy sentence might be imposed on the applicant. On 16 December 2004 the applicant was charged with having committed other offences relating to prostitution, deriving profits from it and participating in an organised criminal gang. On 10 February 2005 the applicant and two co-accused were indicted before the Gdańsk Regional Court. On the same day the trial court extended the applicant’s detention, referring to the grounds given previously and holding that there was a risk that the accused would try to put pressure on witnesses. On 15 March 2005 the Gdańsk Regional Court decided that the Gdynia District Court was competent to try the applicant’s case. That decision was quashed on appeal by the Gdańsk Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) on 27 April 2005. On 28 June, 27 September and 15 December 2005 and 14 March 2006 the Gdańsk Regional Court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention. The trial court reiterated the grounds given previously and found that the accused had not proved the existence of circumstances justifying their release. The court also held that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper course of the trial as not all the witnesses had been heard yet. The applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of 28 June 2005 but it was dismissed on 3 August 2005 by the Gdańsk Court of Appeal. As the length of the applicant’s detention had reached the statutory timelimit of two years laid down in Article 263 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks postępowania karnego), the Regional Court applied to the Gdańsk Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny), asking for the applicant’s detention to be extended beyond that term. The Gdańsk Court of Appeal extended his detention on 18 May and 30 August 2006. The court justified it by the probability that a severe sentence might be imposed on the applicant, which made it likely that, if released, he would obstruct the proceedings. The applicant appealed against the decision of 30 August 2006 but the appeal was dismissed by the Gdańsk Court of Appeal on 13 September 2006. Applications by the applicant for release or for the imposition of other preventive measures were dismissed on 2 February 2005 and on 14 March and 10 August 2006. The trial court held the first hearing on 27 October 2005. Thereafter, hearings were held at regular intervals. On 24 November 2006 the Gdańsk Regional Court gave judgment in the applicant’s case. The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to four years’ imprisonment and a fine. The applicant did not appeal against that judgment and it became final. On 2 December 2006 the applicant was released. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of detention on remand (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its prolongation, release from detention and rules governing other, so-called “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) are set out in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Gołek v. Poland (no. 31330/02, §§ 27-33, 25 April 2006) and Celejewski v. Poland (no. 17584/04, §§ 22-23, 4 August 2006).",0,715
609,609,"5. The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Bad Brückenau, Germany. 6. The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office indicted the applicant for preparation to counterfeit money (section 304 of the Criminal Code). 7. On 30 November 2006 the Budapest Regional Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to a fine. 8. On appeal, the Budapest Court of Appeal held a public session and completed the findings of fact as established by the Regional Court. It observed that the defendant's act could be re-characterised as attempted aggravated fraud (section 318 of the Criminal Code) and enquired as to whether he wished to have an adjournment on that account. The applicant replied in the negative. 9. On 10 October 2007 the Budapest Court of Appeal reversed the first-instance judgment and re-characterised the applicant's offence as forgery of public documents (section 274 of the Criminal Code). The applicant submitted that there had been no taking of evidence in this regard before the Court of Appeal. His sentence remained unchanged; nevertheless, he filed a petition for review. 10. On 30 April 2009 the Supreme Court held a public session and upheld the applicant's conviction without taking evidence. In the reasoning of that decision, it was observed that the judgment of the Court of Appeal amounted to a violation of the substantive provisions of the Criminal Code in that although the applicant, a national of Germany, had committed the crime in question abroad, the lower courts had not explored whether his act was punishable under German law or obtained the Attorney General's requisite endorsement of the indictment. However, the Supreme Court held that the applicant's deed in fact constituted the offences of complicity in attempted aggravated fraud (section 318 of the Criminal Code) and in forgery of private documents (section 276 of the Criminal Code). It did not change the sanction imposed on the applicant. This decision was served on 18 June 2009. 11. Section 274(1) of the Criminal Code provides that a person who prepares a forged official document or falsifies the contents of an official document, uses a fake or forged official document or an official document issued under the name of another person, or co-operates in the inclusion of untrue data, facts or declarations in an official document regarding the existence, change or termination of a right or obligation, commits the felony of forgery of official documents. 12. According to section 276 of the Criminal Code, a person who uses a fake or forged private document or a private document with untrue contents for providing evidence for the existence, change or termination of a right or obligation, commits the offence of forgery of private documents. 13. Under section 304(1) of the Criminal Code, a person who copies or forges money with the purpose of distribution, obtains counterfeit or forged money with the purpose of distribution, exports or imports such money or transports it through the territory of the country, or distributes counterfeit or forged money commits the felony of counterfeiting money. 14. According to section 318(1) of the Criminal Code, a person who deceives someone, or maintains someone's deception, in order to make unlawful gains, commits the offence of fraud, provided that actual damage has occurred as a result of his conduct.",1,544
615,615,"The applicant, Mr Luciano Bellon, is an Italian national who was born in 1945 and lives in Leeds. He was unrepresented before the Court. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant’s wife died on 29 January 1998. On 12 February 2002, the applicant made a claim for widows’ benefits. On 18 February 2002 the applicant was informed that his claim had been disallowed as he was not a woman. On 4 March 2002 the applicant appealed. On 26 March 2003 the decision was upheld. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefit was payable to widowers under United Kingdom law. The domestic law relevant to this application is set out in Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, §§ 40-41, 25 July 2007.",0,174
617,617,"4. The applicant was born in 1941 and lives in Tel-Aviv. 5. On 27 August 1993 the applicant was severely injured in a traffic accident in Moscow. 6. On 12 May 1995 the applicant lodged a civil action before the Chertanovskiy District Court of Moscow against the car driver and the car owner, the Moscow branch of Tveruniversalbank, seeking compensation for damage. She claimed 6,700 US dollars (USD) as compensation for the loss of salary, for medical and travel expenses incurred as a result of the traffic accident and USD 15,000 as compensation for non-pecuniary damage. A copy of the statement of claim produced to the Court bears a stamp of the District Court’s registry showing the registration date as 12 May 1995. 7. On 5 October 1995 the Chertanovskiy District Court, by an interim decision, ordered a medical examination of the applicant by a panel of experts. It put questions about the current state of the applicant’s health, her previous ailments and their possible causes and an eventual need for medical assistance and care. 8. The interim decision of 5 October 1995 was submitted to the Moscow bureau for forensic medical examinations (Бюро судебно-медицинской экспертизы при Комитете здравоохранения города Москвы, hereinafter the “Bureau”). 9. On 13 October 1995 the Bureau asked the District Court for the applicant’s medical documents. 10. According to the Government, upon receipt of the Bureau’s request, the District Court asked the applicant’s lawyer Mr D. Shteynberg, a member of the Moscow Regional Bar Association, to produce additional medical information. No response followed. On an unspecified date the District Court repeated its request. After Mr Shteynberg had failed to respond for the second time, the District Court issued an interim decision on discontinuation of the proceedings. The court returned the applicant’s statement of claims with attached documents to Mr Shteynberg. 11. The applicant indicated that neither she nor her lawyer had received the District Court’s request for additional information and that they had not been notified of the District Court’s interim decision on discontinuation of the proceedings. 12. In 2002 the applicant complained to the president of the Chertanovskiy District Court about an excessive length of the proceedings. 13. On 18 July 2002 the Chertanovskiy District Court informed the applicant that, according to the registration log for the year of 1995, the applicant’s claim against the bank had never been registered by the District Court. 14. In August 2002 Mr Shteynberg inquired of the Bureau whether the expert examination ordered by the decision of 5 October 1995 had been carried out. 15. By letter of 19 August 2002, the Bureau responded to Mr Shteynberg that, having received no response from the District Court for additional medical information, it had not carried out any examination. 16. On 7 October 2002 the President of the Chertanovskiy District Court reported to the applicant that, according to the registration logs of the Chertanovskiy District Court for the years of 1995 to 2002, the District Court did not have a civil case to which the applicant and the Moscow branch of Tveruniversalbank were the parties. 17. The RSFSR Code on Civil Procedure of 11 June 1964 (in force at the material time) provided that civil cases were to be prepared for a hearing no later than seven days after the action had been lodged with the court. Civil cases were to be examined no later than one month after the preparation for the hearing had been completed (Article 99) 18. Summonses were to be served on the parties and their representatives in such way so that they would have enough time to appear timely at the hearing and prepare their case. If necessary, the parties could be summoned by a phone call or a telegram (Article 106). 19. A court could adjourn examination of a case when an expert examination had been ordered (Article 215). 20. Article 221 set out an exhaustive list of grounds for issuing an interim decision on discontinuation of the proceedings (определение об оставлении заявления без рассмотрения), that is if parties failed to make use of a preliminary non-judicial avenue of solving a dispute; if an action was lodged by an incapacitated person or by a person lacking the authority to act; if the parties, without valid reasons, failed to attend two hearings; and if the same dispute between the same parties was pending before a court. 21. A copy of an interim decision on discontinuation of the proceedings was to be sent to the absent party no later than three days upon its delivery (Article 213). 22. Files in civil cases concerning claims for compensation for health damage were to be kept by first-instance courts for seventy-five years (Item 7 (A) (115) of the List of documents of the USSR Ministry of Justice, justice departments and authorities, and courts with indication of their period of keeping, approved by the USSR Ministry of Justice on 31 January 1980). 23. Original decisions on discontinuation of civil proceedings must be kept permanently (Paragraph 5.4 of the Instruction on the procedure for keeping, selecting and archiving of court documents, approved by Order no. 13 of the USSR Minister of Justice on 17 September 1980).",1,864
620,620,"The applicant, Mr Richard Owens, is a British national who was born in 1944 and lives in London. He was represented before the Court by Royds Rdw, solicitors in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant's wife died on 2 August 1999 leaving dependent children. In November 2000 the applicant applied for widows' benefits. On 8 November 2000 the applicant was informed that his claim had been disallowed. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefit was payable to widowers under United Kingdom law. The applicant was in receipt of Incapacity Benefit at the relevant time, the amount of which exceeded the rate of Widowed Mother's Allowance. The domestic law relevant to this application is set out in Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, §§ 1426, ECHR 2002-IV and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, §§ 40-41, 25 July 2007.",0,194
622,622,"4. The applicants were born in 1964, 1969, 1964, 1971, 1961, 1965, 1971, 1975, 1964, 1971 and 1965 respectively, and live in Adıyaman. 5. On 30 April 1999 the Adıyaman Governor authorised the holding of May Day celebrations in the Adıyaman Amphitheatre, located in the Hasancık District. 6. On 1 May 1999 a group of people, including the applicants, gathered in the building of the Health Workers’ Trade Union and started to walk towards the amphitheatre for the May Day celebrations. They were stopped by police officers. Stating that they had obtained prior authorisation from the Governor, the group attempted to continue its march. The police then intervened to disperse the group; the applicants were allegedly injured during this incident as a result of the force used by the police. According to the incident report, thirty-eight people, including the applicants, were arrested. The applicants were subsequently taken to the Adıyaman State Hospital, where they were examined by a doctor. The medical reports in respect of Ms Zeynep Saya, Mr Hasan Ölgün, Mr Müslüm Atasoy, Ms Zöhre Taş, Mr Nedim Çifçi and Ms Hediye Kilinç stated that there were no signs of ill-treatment on their bodies. As regards the remaining applicants, the following findings were indicated in the respective medical reports: – Şeyho Saya: Tenderness on the back of the right leg and on the back. – Çetin Taş: Tenderness on the lower left side of the chest and pain while breathing. Tenderness and pain on the right side of the forehead. Possible fracture of the ribs on the left side of the chest. – Akın Doğan: Scratches on the back. – Ali Murat Bilgiç: Tenderness and bruises on the left shoulder and the left arm. – Bahattin Barış Bilgiç: Scratches on the right elbow, the right knee and hyperaemia on the left side of the chest. 7. The applicants were then taken into custody. They were released the next day. 8. On different dates in May 1999 the applicants filed criminal complaints with the Adıyaman Public Prosecutor against those police officers who had allegedly used excessive force during their arrest. 9. On 17 June 1999 the Adıyaman Public Prosecutor transferred the case file to the Adıyaman Provincial Administrative Council, seeking authorisation to bring criminal proceedings against the accused officers, pursuant to the provisions of Law on the prosecution of Civil Servants. 10. On 16 February 2000 the Adıyaman Provincial Administrative Council found that there was not enough evidence to initiate criminal proceedings against the accused officers and consequently refused to do so. On 1 September 2000 the applicants appealed against this decision. In their appeal petition, they invoked a breach of Article 11 of the Convention, arguing that the police interference had breached their freedom of assembly. On 14 June 2001 the Supreme Administrative Council upheld the decision of the Administrative Council. 11. In the meantime, on 1 June 1999 the Adıyaman Public Prosecutor, after examining a video recording of the incident, delivered a decision not to prosecute with regard to seventy demonstrators – including the applicants – who had been involved in the incident on 1 May 1999. In reaching his decision, the Public Prosecutor stated that the demonstrators had been stopped by the police, although they had been walking silently along the pavement, without presenting a danger to the public or engaging in any violent activities. It was also indicated in the decision that, pursuant to section 24 of the Assemblies and Marches Act (Law no. 2911), the police were under an obligation to warn the group out loud to disperse; however, it was observed from the recording of the incident that they had failed to do so. In consequence, the public prosecutor held that the accused had not violated Law no. 2911.",1,625
628,628,"5. The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in the town of Malaya Vyska, the Kirovograd region, Ukraine. 6. On 9 April 1997 the applicant sold his house for UAH 35,000 to the Kirovograd Regional Department of Justice (hereafter “the Department”), responsible for the logistical support of the judiciary. The Department was represented in the transaction by Mr R., the President of the Malaya Vyska City Court. The contract was certified by a notary and specified that the purchase price had to be paid in two instalments: UAH 5,000 and 30,000 to be paid by 1 May 1997 and 1 September 1997 respectively. The contract also contained a clause stating the following: “In case if the exchange rate of the Hryvna depreciates the overall sum to be paid cannot be less than the Hryvna equivalent of USD 17,000.” 7. In June 1997 the applicant was paid UAH 5,000. In 1998 the Hryvna substantially weakened against US dollar. In October 1998 and August 1999 the applicant received UAH 11,000 and 20,000 respectively. 8. The applicant instituted proceedings against the Department, claiming that it had failed to fulfil its obligations under the contract, as the sum paid did not take into account the substantial depreciation of the exchange rate of the Hryvna. Thus, according to the applicant, he had lost some USD 6,553. 9. On 4 November 1999 the Kirovsky District Court of Kirovograd (hereafter “the District Court”) rejected this claim as unsubstantiated. On 8 September 2000 the Presidium of the Kirovograd Regional Court, following the protest (extraordinary appeal) of the Deputy President of this court, quashed the judgment and remitted the case. 10. On 29 November 2000, in the course of a new hearing, the Department lodged a counterclaim seeking the annulment of the contract on the ground that Mr R. had exceeded his powers in agreeing to the dollar value clause. 11. On 24 July 2001 the Kirovsky District Court of Kirovograd granted the applicant’s claim and rejected that of the Department. The court established that the clause in issue aimed at ensuring the stability of the contract and protecting the applicant against inflation. The court further found that the applicant had suffered increased financial losses due to the erosion of the Hryvna’s purchasing power during the lengthy delay in execution of the contract. It found that the amount eventually paid to him on the date of the final transaction had only been USD 10,457.50. The court awarded the applicant UAH 35,527.77 in compensation for the devaluation of the Hryvna, UAH 3,197.31 in statutory interest for the delay and UAH 502.13 in court costs. 12. The Department appealed against this judgment and, on 20 December 2001, the Kirovograd Regional Court of Appeal (hereafter “the Court of Appeal”) quashed it and rejected the applicant’s claim. The court found in favour of the Department on both of their objections. It noted that Mr R. had acted ultra vires by conceding the inclusion of the disputed provision in the contract without the prior consent from the Department. The Court of Appeal further stated that, according to Article 3 of the Governmental Decree on the Regime of Currency Regulation and Currency Control 1993 (the 1993 Decree), the Hryvna was the only currency which could be used for internal transactions. The court did not find convincing the District Court’s argument that the impugned clause protected the applicant from inflation, since Article 214 of the Civil Code 1963 provided for compensation for losses incurred due to inflation if the execution of a contract was delayed. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the price for the apartment was paid with considerable delay and that the applicant, having made the relevant claim before the court, had the right to be awarded statutory interest at the rate of 3% per annum. Taking into account that the applicant had already received an extra thousand Hryvnas (paragraph 6 above), the Court of Appeal found it appropriate to award him further UAH 678.50. 13. On 30 May 2002 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s request for leave to appeal in cassation. 14. Article 3 of the Decree provided that the currency of Ukraine (i.e. the Hryvna) was the only lawful means of payment in Ukraine. 15. According to Article 48 of the Code, a contract concluded contrary to the law should be declared invalid. If the contract is invalidated the parties should return to each other all that was received in execution of the contract. 16. Article 214 of the Code provided that a debtor who had delayed the execution of a financial undertaking was obliged, on the request of the creditor, to pay the debt taking into account the established index of inflation for the period of delay, as well as statutory interest at 3% per annum.",0,797
630,630,"8. The applicant was born in 1931 and lives in Krasnodar. 9. In 1993 the applicant sued his former employer, the public company “KAPRSM”, for unpaid compensation for a work-related injury, caused by a lorry owned by another company, “KTS”. 10. On 21 April 1997 the Takhtamukayskiy District Court found for the applicant and awarded him a lump sum and life-long monthly payments. The lump sum was made up of the principal amount, interest thereon and a penalty for belated payments. 11. On 3 June 1997 the Supreme Court of the Adygheya Republic set aside the judgment in the part concerning the claim for penalty and remitted that claim for a new examination. It upheld the remainder of the judgment. The claim for penalty was subsequently examined by courts of various levels. As of March 2002 the claim was pending before the District Court. 12. On 15 March 2002 the acting President of the Takhtamukayskiy District Court lodged an application (представление) with the Supreme Court of the Adygheya Republic to quash the judgment of 21 April 1997 and all other judgments in the case, because the defendant in the applicant’s action should have been KTS that had owned the lorry rather than KAPRSM that had been the applicant’s employer. 13. According to the Government, on 15 August 2002 the Supreme Court informed the applicant that the above application would be examined at a hearing on 27 August 2002. 14. On 27 August 2002 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Adygheya Republic granted the application and quashed the previous judgments, including those of 21 April and 3 June 1997. It found that those judgments had been unlawful because the lower courts had failed to determine the proper defendant. The applicant’s claims were remitted for a new examination. 15. In the resumed proceedings, on 12 May 2003 the Takhtamukayskiy District Court established that the applicant had been informed of the possibility to substitute the legal successor of the KTS company as the proper defendant and to join the regional branch of the Social Security Fund as a third party, but he had not agreed to the substitution. His claim was therefore dismissed as being directed against an improper defendant. 16. In his observations on the admissibility and merits of the case of 25 November 2003, the applicant made certain abrasive remarks which prompted the respondent’s Government request to declare the application inadmissible as an abuse of the right of petition. 17. In its admissibility decision of 8 July 2004, the Court rejected the Government’s request for the reason that they had not identified the allegedly abusive expressions or passages in the applicant’s submissions and as the application had not been knowingly based on untrue facts. The Court noted, nevertheless, that some of the applicant’s statements had been irrelevant and excessively emotional. 18. In September 2004 the applicant and the Government filed their observations on the merits of the application. The Section President set 11 November 2004 as the time-limit by which the parties could submit written comments in reply to each other’s observations. 19. In a letter of 19 October 2004, the applicant commented on the Government’s observations in the same abrasive manner. 20. In their observations on the merits of the case and letters of 14 December 2004 and 18 January 2005, the Government invited the Court to declare the application inadmissible as an abuse of the right of petition. Drawing a parallel between the conduct of Mr L.R. (see L. R. v. Austria, no. 2424/65, Commission decision of 24 May 1966) and that of the applicant, they claimed that the expressions used by the applicant were even more insulting than those used by Mr L. R. against the representatives of the Austrian Government. The Government reproached the Court for not having invited the applicant to withdraw or amend the objectionable statements. They submitted that the applicant’s letter of 19 October 2004 was a further evidence of his abusive attitude to the proceedings before the Court. 21. On 29 September 2005 the Court considered the Government’s request to declare the application inadmissible in connection with the applicant’s persistent use of offensive language and invited the applicant to withdraw his inappropriate remarks and to offer a formal apology. 22. By letter of 3 November 2005, the applicant informed the Court as follows (translated from Russian): “I formally withdraw my rough remarks about the Government and about the Government’s representative Mr Laptev which were considered offensive. I also offer my sincere apology to the Court, to the Government and to Mr Laptev. It was not my intention to offend anyone...” 23. In their comments on the applicant’s letter, the Government asked the applicant to identify the expressions he apologised for.",1,789
634,634,"The applicant, born in 1952, is an Austrian national residing in Vienna. In the proceedings before the Court he is represented by Mr. G. Grone, a lawyer practising in Vienna. A. On 23 March 1995 officers of the Vienna Federal Police Authority (Bundespolizeidirektion) searched the applicant’s home on the suspicion that he owned and distributed pornographic material involving minors. They informed the applicant that the investigating judge had issued a search warrant orally. A written copy of the search warrant was not served on the applicant until 16 November 1995. On 24 April 1995 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Vienna Independent Administrative Panel (Unabhängiger Verwaltungssenat). He submitted that it was not clear in the circumstances whether a search warrant had been issued as claimed by the police officers. Thus, the search of his premises lacked a legal basis and violated his right to respect for his home. On 21 August 1995 the Vienna Independent Administrative Panel rejected the applicant’s complaint as being inadmissible. It found that the police had acted upon an oral search warrant from the investigating judge and the search of the applicant’s premises was, thus, attributable to the court. Consequently, the review of its lawfulness did not fall within the competence of the Independent Administrative Panel. On 9 October 1995 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Review Chamber (Ratskammer) of the Vienna Regional Criminal Court (Landesgericht für Strafsachen), claiming that the search of his premises violated his right to respect for his home. He submitted in particular that no written copy of the search warrant had been served on him within the statutory twenty-four hour time-limit. On 21 December 1995 the Review Chamber of the Regional Criminal Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint as being unfounded. It noted that the court had conducted criminal proceedings against a number of persons on suspicion of sexual abuse of minors. In the course of these proceedings a letter was seized which proved that a certain M. dealt with pornographic material involving minors. Subsequently, since the applicant was identified as the person using the cover name M. Thereupon, the investigating judge issued a search warrant for the applicant’s premises. At the time, a written copy of the search warrant was not issued and, thus, was not served on the applicant. The Review Chamber further noted that the search was carried out in the presence of the applicant who was first informed of the suspicion and was requested to hand over any pornographic material in his possession. As he refused to do so, the search was carried out and extensive pornographic material as well as business correspondence was seized. Having regard to its above findings, the Review Chamber concluded that there was a reasonable suspicion, as required by S. 139 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung), that objects which were of importance for specific criminal proceedings were to be found on the applicant’s premises. Moreover, the search had, in accordance with S. 140 of the said Code, been ordered by a judicial search warrant. The failure to serve a written copy of the search warrant on the applicant, though contrary to the law, did not affect the lawfulness of the search itself. On 29 April 1996 this decision was served on the applicant’s counsel. B. Relevant domestic law 1862 Protection of the Home Act (Gesetz zum Schutz des Hausrechts 1862) S. 1 of the 1862 Act provides that a search of premises may, as a rule, only be carried out on the basis of a reasoned search warrant issued by a judge. The search warrant has to be served on the person concerned either immediately or within twenty-four hours. Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung) S. 139 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that a search of premises may only be carried out if there is a reasonable suspicion that a person suspected of having committed a criminal offence is hiding in the premises concerned, or that there are objects the possession or examination of which is relevant for a particular criminal investigation. According to S. 140 § 1 a search may, as a rule, only be carried out after the person concerned has been questioned, and if the objects sought are not voluntarily handed over. S. 140 § 3 states that a search may, as a rule, only be carried out on the basis of a reasoned search warrant issued by a judge. The search warrant has to be served on the person concerned either immediately or within twenty-four hours.",0,754
635,635,"8. The applicant was born in 1972. He lives in Šiauliai. 9. The applicant, a former police investigator, was suspected of abuse of office and bribery. His detention on remand was ordered by the Šiauliai City District Court on 12 March 1999 on the fear of his absconding and influencing witnesses. His remand in custody was thereafter prolonged. 10. On 3 October 2000 the Šiauliai Regional Court convicted the applicant of abuse of office and bribery, sentencing him to eight years’ imprisonment. On 29 June 2001 the Court of Appeal upheld the lower judgment. On 18 December 2001 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s cassation appeal in the case. The sentence was subsequently reduced in view of an amnesty law. The applicant was released from prison after having completed the sentence on 18 August 2003. 11. According to the applicant, all his letters to and from the State authorities, non-governmental organisations as well private persons - namely his family, relatives, friends and legal counsel - were opened up and read in his absence while he was in the Šiauliai remand prison during the period from 12 March 1999 until 20 July 2001. The applicant states that a total of 362 of his letters had been opened and read. The applicant has submitted a letter addressed to his lawyer by the Šiauliai remand prison administration on 18 February 2004, attesting that during the period from 15 March 1999 to 20 July 2001 the applicant had sent letters to 241 addressees, including the State authorities, NGOs, the European Court of Human Rights, and various third persons. All of these letters were listed in detail by the prison administration, with reference to their date, addressee, and their number in the applicant’s file. 12. Article 22 of the Constitution guarantees the right to respect for one’s private life, family life and correspondence. According to Article 15 of the Detention on Remand Act 1996 and Rule 72 of the Remand Prisons Internal Rules 1996, which were applicable at the material time, remanded persons’ letters could be subject to censorship. Rule 75 of the Remand Prisons Internal Rules provides that the remand centre administration cannot open letters of detainees addressed to the European Court of Human Rights if those letters were given to the administration to be sent in a closed envelope. Rule 83 provides that the remand prison administration shall familiarise the detainee with a reply to his correspondence within three days following receipt of the letter addressed to the detainee. Therefore, all letters received by the detainees are not given to them and are kept in their files by the remand centre administration.",1,439
638,638,"4. The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in the Rivne Region. 5. On 13 March 1996 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Sarny Court against a private company, Vysotskyy, for non-fulfilment of its contractual obligations, under which it should have provided the applicant with agricultural products. 6. On 1 July 1997 the Sarny Court left the applicant’s complaint without consideration, holding that it fell within the jurisdiction of the commercial courts. 7. On 28 July 1997 the Rivne Regional Court quashed that ruling and remitted the case for a fresh consideration. 8. On 22 December 1997 the Sarny Court rejected the applicant’s claims as unsubstantiated. 9. On 26 January 1998 the Rivne Court quashed that decision and remitted the case for a fresh consideration. 10. On 19 May 1998 the Sarny Court found in part for the applicant. 11. On 13 July 1998 the Rivne Court upheld that decision. 12. On 23 December 1998 the Presidium of the Rivne Court, following an objection (протест) lodged by its President, quashed the decisions of the lower courts and remitted the case to the Sarny Court for a fresh consideration. 13. On an unspecified date the Vysotskyy company lodged a counterclaim with that court seeking the annulment of the contract. After December 1998 the case was reconsidered by the courts at three levels of jurisdiction on four occasions because the courts of first instance and appeal had committed factual and legal errors in their decisions. 14. On 3 March 2003 the Dubrovytsya Town Court allowed the applicant’s claim in part and ordered the successor of the Vysotskyy company, Zlagoda, to transfer thirty-three tons of potatoes, worth 15,196 Ukrainian hryvnas (UAH), and eight tons of wheat, worth UAH 2,598, to the applicant. It also ordered the applicant to return 3,855 kg of meat, worth UAH 11,133, to Zlagoda. 15. On 27 June 2003 the Rivne Regional Court of Appeal upheld that judgment. On 4 February 2005 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s appeal in cassation. 16. In the course of the proceedings twenty-seven hearings were adjourned, two of which were adjourned due to the applicant’s failure to attend and the remaining twenty-five due to the need to call witnesses or due to their or their respondent’s failure to attend. 17. On an unspecified date the Bailiffs started enforcement proceedings in respect of the judgment of 3 March 2003. 18. On 11 January 2007 the Rivne Court modified the procedure of enforcement, ordering the Zlagoda company to pay the applicant UAH 17,794 for the products due to him under the judgment of 3 March 2003. 19. On 7 February 2007 the Dubrovytsya Court, following a request by the Zlagoda company to modify the procedure of enforcement of the judgment of 3 March 2003, ordered cross-cancellation of the debts under that judgment in the amount of UAH 11,133 and ruled that Zlagoda was to pay the applicant UAH 6,661. The ruling of 7 February 2007 was not appealed against and became final. 20. On 21 February 2007 the judgment of 3 March 2003 was enforced in full. 21. In March 2007 the applicant instituted proceedings against the Zlagoda company, seeking compensation for the difference between the award paid and the in market prices of the products due to him under the judgment of 3 March 2003. 22. On 5 June 2007 the Dubrovytsya Court rejected the applicant’s claims as unsubstantiated. 23. On 18 July 2007 the Rivne Court quashed that decision and discontinued the proceedings in the case, holding that the issue had been settled by the final judgment of 3 March 2003. 24. On 27 August 2008 the Supreme Court quashed the decision of 18 July 2007 and remitted the case for a fresh consideration to the Rivne Court, before which it is still pending.",1,632
650,650,"4. The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Łęczna. 5. On 18 October 2000 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having committed a number of offences in an organised criminal group. 6. On 20 October 2000 the Lublin District Court remanded the applicant in custody. The applicant's detention was subsequently prolonged by the courts on 16 January 2001, 17 March 2001, 7 August 2001, 10 October 2001 and 9 January 2002. 7. On 10 April 2002 the Lublin Court of Appeal ordered that the applicant and his 3 co-accused be kept in custody until 18 June 2002. It relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged. The Court of Appeal also found that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant would obstruct the proceedings, given the serious nature of the charges and the fact that they concerned an organised criminal group. It further relied on the severity of the anticipated penalty and the complexity of the case. 8. On 11 June 2002 the prosecution filed with the Lublin Regional Court a bill of indictment against the applicant. The applicant was charged, inter alia, with acting in and leading an organised armed criminal group, ordering murder, extortion and supplying drugs. 9. On 14 June 2002 the Lublin Regional Court extended the applicant's detention until 30 September 2002, referring to the severity of the anticipated penalty. 10. On 25 September 2002 the Lublin Court of Appeal prolonged the applicant's detention until 3 February 2003. In addition to the grounds invoked in the detention order of 14 June 2002, the Court of Appeal relied on the complexity of the case and the number of charges. 11. On 29 January 2003 the Court of Appeal ordered that the applicant and 3 of his co-accused be held in custody until 30 June 2003. It invoked the same grounds as in its earlier decision. 12. On 25 June 2003 the Court of Appeal prolonged the applicant's detention until 30 October 2003. In addition to the grounds previously invoked, it held that the volume of evidence and the need to proceed smoothly with the trial justified the applicant's continued detention. 13. On 22 October 2003 the Court of Appeal extended the applicant's detention until 31 January 2004. It observed that holding the applicant in custody was the only measure which could secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, having particular regard to the security of anonymous witnesses who had been heard in the proceedings. It also considered that the case was particularly complex within the meaning of Article 263 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 14. The applicant's detention was subsequently prolonged by the Court of Appeal on 30 December 2003 (until 19 March 2004) and 17 March 2004 (until 5 June 2004). The court invoked the same grounds as in its earlier decisions. 15. On 2 June 2004 the Court of Appeal prolonged the applicant's detention until 5 September 2004. Having regard to the organised character of the alleged criminal activities, it held that the applicant's detention was necessary in order to prevent him and the other co-accused from interfering with the proceedings. On 11 August 2004 the Court of Appeal ordered that the applicant be held in custody until 5 December 2004. It relied on the same grounds as previously. 16. The trial court held about 59 hearings. On 3 December 2004 the Lublin Regional Court delivered a judgment. It convicted the applicant of most of the charges and acquitted him of one charge (ordering murder). It sentenced him to seven years' imprisonment and a fine. 17. The applicant appealed against the first-instance judgment. He remained in detention pending appeal. On 4 October 2005 the Court of Appeal upheld the Regional Court's judgment for the most part. It remitted the case only in respect of one charge of which the applicant had been acquitted. 18. In the course of the proceedings the applicant filed a number of applications for release on health grounds. However, the courts, having regard to the relevant expert reports, refused all those applications. He also unsuccessfully appealed against decisions prolonging his detention on remand. 19. The relevant domestic law and practice regarding the imposition of detention on remand (tymczasowe aresztowanie), the grounds for its prolongation, release from detention and rules governing other, so-called “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) at the material time are stated in the Court's judgments in the cases of Gołek v. Poland, no. 31330/02, §§ 27-33, 25 April 2006 and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, §§ 22-23, 4 August 2006.",1,767
660,660,"5. The applicants were born in 1984, 1980, 1955 and 1979 respectively and live in Istanbul. 6. On 17 October 2003 the applicants took part in an anti-war demonstration in Istanbul. The gathering was dispersed by police officers and the applicants were arrested and taken into police custody where they remained until their release the following day. The applicants allege that they were subjected to ill-treatment during their arrest and their detention in custody. 7. According to an incident report drawn up by a number of police officers on 17 October 2003, fifty to sixty persons, including the applicants, gathered in a square in Istanbul at 7.45 p.m. and chanted anti-war slogans, protesting against the Government’s proposals to send soldiers to participate in the invasion of Iraq. The police had warned them with loudspeakers that they were disturbing the flow of traffic and had unsuccessfully asked them to disperse. When the police had attempted to arrest some of the demonstrators and put them into the police vehicles, a number of the demonstrators had displayed “rowdy behaviour” and the police had had to use force against them. A total of six persons, including the applicants, had been arrested and taken to a police station at 8.30 p.m. the same evening. This incident report was signed by six police officers who were only referred to in the report with their identification numbers. 8. The same day the applicants were examined by a doctor. According to the medical reports, the second and third applicants had no signs of ill-treatment on their bodies. The first applicant had bruising on her lower lip and on her lower right leg. The fourth applicant had bruising on the left side of his lower back and on the back of his right ear. His legs were also sensitive and he had redness in his left eye. 9. The same evening the applicants were questioned by the police in the presence of a duty lawyer. With the exception of the third applicant, all the applicants exercised their right to remain silent. 10. The following day the applicants were examined by a doctor once more. According to the medical reports, there were no signs of ill-treatment on the applicants’ bodies other than those mentioned in the medical reports drawn up the previous day. 11. At around 2 p.m. the same day the applicants were brought before the Bakırköy prosecutor. The applicants told the prosecutor that by attending the demonstration they had been exercising their democratic rights. They also alleged that the police had arrested them without any previous warnings. The fourth applicant complained that he had been beaten up by the police officers. The first and fourth applicants also complained that police chief M. T. had sworn at them during their time in police custody. The same day the applicants were released. 12. On 21 October 2003 the Bakırköy prosecutor asked for an investigation to be opened into the applicants’ allegations of ill-treatment. 13. The applicants submitted a formal complaint to the Bakırköy prosecutor on 5 November 2003. With the exception of the third applicant, Mr Hacı Badem, the applicants complained of ill-treatment. Referring to Article 3 of the Convention the three applicants stated that the police officers had punched and kicked them in the course of their arrests, as well as during their detention at the police station. 14. Between 10 December 2003 and 13 April 2004 the Bakırköy prosecutor questioned eleven police officers. Ten of the police officers denied having been at the demonstration or having seen any of the demonstrators because they had been working elsewhere at the time. The remaining officer, police chief M.T., told the prosecutor that he had not taken part in the dispersal of the demonstration but had questioned the applicants in police custody. He denied having ill-treated any of the arrestees or having sworn at them. 15. On 14 April 2004 the Bakırköy prosecutor decided to close the investigation into the applicants’ allegations of ill-treatment. On the basis of the documents in the file the prosecutor considered that when the applicants refused to disperse the police had had to use force against them. The applicants’ “simple injuries” had thus been caused when the police had been exercising their statutory powers on the use of force. 16. The applicants’ objection against the prosecutor’s decision was rejected by the Eyüp Assize Court on 8 December 2004. This decision stated that it was to be served on the applicants. 17. According to a hand-written note on this decision, it was communicated to the applicants on 9 February 2005. 18. In the meantime, on 21 October 2003 criminal proceedings were instigated against the applicants for having taken part in an unlawful demonstration, in breach of sections 33, 36 and 40 of the Meetings and Demonstration Marches Act (Law no. 2911). 19. On 28 January 2008 the Bakırköy Criminal Court of First Instance acquitted the applicants, holding that they had exercised their democratic rights and not committed any offences.",1,832
661,661,"3. The applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Istanbul. 4. On an unspecified date in the late 1980s the General Directorate of National Roads and Highways (Devlet Karayolları Genel Müdürlüğü) (“the General Directorate”) decided to partially expropriate the applicant’s land located in the Küçükçekmece district of Istanbul. The applicant only found out about this expropriation in May 2004. 5. On 21 May 2004 the applicant brought a civil action before the Küçükçekmece Civil Court for additional expropriation compensation. 6. On 21 June 2004 the title to the property was transferred to the General Directorate. 7. On 19 July 2005 the Küçükçekmece Civil Court awarded the applicant 783,749,741,900 Turkish liras (TRL) as additional compensation, plus interest at the statutory rate. 8. On 6 March 2006 the Court of Cassation upheld the first-instance court’s judgment. 9. The applicant subsequently initiated execution proceedings before the Şişli Execution Office to obtain her additional compensation. 10. On 31 July 2008 the applicant received a partial payment of 1,159,699.20 Turkish liras (TRY). 11. On 5 August 2008 the applicant brought a case before the Şişli Execution Court in respect of the General Directorate’s outstanding debt and the interest rate that should be applied to that amount. 12. On 24 October 2008 the Şişli Execution Court held that the General Directorate had an outstanding debt of TRY 479,605.44, payable with an interest rate of 30% running from 31 July 2008. 13. On 14 November 2008 the General Directorate appealed the judgment of the Şişli Execution Court. On 2 June 2009 the Court of Cassation upheld that judgment. 14. On 12 April 2010 the General Directorate paid the applicant TRY 745,797.18 to discharge its outstanding debt, together with interest. 15. The relevant domestic law and practice are set out in the cases of Akkuş v. Turkey (judgment of 9 July 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV); Aka v. Turkey (judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998-VI); Gaganuş and Others v. Turkey (no. 39335/98, §§ 15-19, 5 June 2001); Ak v. Turkey (no. 27150/02, §§ 11-13, 31 July 2007); Sarıca and Dilaver v.

668,668,"4. The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Bratislava. 5. On 29 March 1993 the applicant brought an action against the Bratislava II Housing Cooperative (Stavebné bytové družstvo), of which she had formerly been a member, in the Bratislava II District Court (at that time Obvodný súd, at present Okresný súd). She challenged a decision of the defendant of 26 October 1992 concerning her entitlement to a new flat and the procedure applied by the defendant in dealing with her appeal against it. 6. On 16 December 1993 the District Court held a hearing at which the applicant provided further particulars of her action in that she was seeking a ruling declaring that she had the right to the new flat. 7. On 13 January 1994 the District Court ruled that the applicant had a right to the new flat in question. The defendant challenged the judgment by an appeal (odvolanie). 8. On 13 October 1994 the Bratislava Regional Court (at that time Mestský súd, at present Krajský súd) held a hearing of the appeal and invited the defendant to submit further evidence which the defendant did on 27 October 1994. 9. On 26 January 1995, following another hearing of the appeal held on the same day, the Regional Court overturned the judgment of 13 January 1994 and dismissed the action. 10. On 20 April 1995 the applicant challenged the judgment of 24 January 1995 by an appeal on points of law (dovolanie). 11. On 21 November 1995 the applicant’s lawyer informed the District Court that he was no longer representing her. As legal representation in appeals on points of law was mandatory, the District Court invited the applicant to identify her new representative on 14 December 1995 and, in the absence of a reply, again on 26 March 1996. The applicant finally replied on 25 April 1996. The appeal on points of law was then submitted to the Supreme Court (Najvyšší súd) for a determination. 12. On 4 October 1996 the Supreme Court returned the casefile to the District Court without a decision, on the ground that the power of attorney for the applicant’s legal representation did not state expressly that it applied to proceedings on appeals on points of law as was required under the applicable procedural rules. 13. On 11 December 1996 and repeatedly on 21 April 1997 the District Court requested that the applicant’s lawyer correct the power of attorney, which he did on 15 July 1997. 14. On 28 October 1997 the Supreme Court quashed the judgments of 13 January 1994 and 26 January 1995, finding that the lower courts had determined the action in a manner in which it had never actually been formulated. As the action fell to be determined at first instance by the Regional Court, it was remitted to it. 15. Between 28 March and 17 October 2000 the Regional Court held 6 hearings. 16. On 23 October 2000, following another hearing held on the same day, the Regional Court dismissed the action. The applicant challenged the judgment by an appeal. 17. On 19 December 2001, following a hearing of the appeal held on the same day, the Supreme Court upheld the judgment of 23 October 2000.",1,538
670,670,"The applicants, Mr Dalibor Blaha and Ms Marta Blahová, are Czech nationals who were born in 1969 and 1970 respectively and live in Zlín. The Czech Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr V.A. Schorm, from the Ministry of Justice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 26 November 1993 the applicants issued proceedings before the Zlín District Court (okresní soud) against a private company claiming damages in the amount of CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 41,038). On 21 December 1993 they paid court fees. On 24 March 1995 the District Court found that it lacked material competence to deal with the applicants' case and transmitted it to the Brno Regional Commercial Court (krajský obchodní soud). On 20 July 1994 the defendant filed a counterclaim requesting payment of CZK 275,000 (EUR 11,285). In a judgment of 17 February 2000 the Regional Court dismissed the action in respect of the second applicant. It granted, at the same time, the defendant's counterclaim ordering her to pay CZK 275,000 to the defendant. It further decided to split the first applicant's claim and the defendant's counterclaim brought in the first applicant's respect for a separated hearing. On 25 April 2000 the Regional Court found that the District Court was materially competent to deal with the action in respect of the first applicant as well as with the defendant's counterclaim, and remitted the case to it. On 2 November 2000 the District Court suspended the proceedings until the delivery of a final judgment in the proceedings concerning the second applicant's action. In a judgment of 21 November 2005 the District Court dismissed the applicant's action and partly granted the defendant's counterclaim. The applicant appealed. It appears that the proceedings are still pending. On 18 April 2000 the second applicant appealed to the Olomouc High Court (vrchní soud). On 21 March 2002 the District Court, upon the defendant's request of 18 March 2000, commenced execution proceedings ordering the applicant to pay CZK 150,000 (EUR 6,156) with interests on late payment to the defendant. On 10 November 2003 the District Court discontinued the execution proceedings in respect of the interests on late payment and ordered the enforcement of the Regional Court's judgment by sale of the second applicant's property. It dismissed the applicant's request to postpone the execution. On 21 December 2003 the first applicant filed an appeal against this decision. On 29 December 2003 the second applicant appealed. On 19 August 2005 the Brno Regional Court (krajský soud) rejected the first applicant's appeal on the ground that he was not a party to the proceedings before it. It discontinued the proceedings in respect of the second applicant's appeal, and upheld the first four grounds of the decision while quashing the District Court's dismissal to suspend the execution. The latter part of the case was therefore sent back to the District Court for further consideration. It appears that the execution proceedings are still ongoing. On 23 December 2003 the second applicant claimed material damages allegedly caused by activities of the organs of judicial power, pursuant to Act no. 82/1998 then in force. Subsequently, the Ministry informed the applicant that her claim had been rejected. According to the applicant, the Ministry had admitted that there had been delays in the proceedings before the Regional Commercial Court and the High Court but had denied any causal link between the material damage alleged by the applicant and delays in the proceedings. On 5 August 2004 the second applicant brought an action for damages against the Ministry of Justice pursuant to section 15(2) of Act no. 82/1998 then in force maintaining that the proceedings brought against the private company in 1993 had lasted an unreasonably long time. In a judgment of 27 March 2006 the District Court dismissed her action. On 25 October 2007 the Brno Regional Court (krajský soud) upheld the merits of the first instance court's judgment. Section 13(1) as in force until 26 April 2006 provided that the State was liable for damage caused by an irregularity in the conduct of proceedings, including non-compliance with the obligation to perform an act or give a decision within the statutory time-limit. Under section 13(2) a person who had suffered loss on account of such an irregularity was entitled to damages. On 27 April 2006 Act no. 160/2006 entered into force amending, inter alia, section 13(1) which newly provides that the State is liable for damage caused by an irregularity in the conduct of proceedings, including non-compliance with the obligation to perform an act or give a decision within the statutory time-limit. If the law does not fix a time-limit for these purposes, it is considered that a violation of the duty to perform the act or give the decision within a reasonable time-limit is also considered as an irregularity in the conduct of proceedings. When using the notion of “reasonable time”, the Act refers to Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention. Act no. 160/2006 also introduced a new section 31a which provides for a reasonable satisfaction for moral prejudice caused by an irregularity in the conduct of proceedings including non-compliance with the obligation to perform an act or to adopt a decision within a reasonable time.",0,876
671,671,"6. The applicants were born in 1952, 1954, 1961, 1960, 1964, 1963 and 1945 respectively and live in Malta. They are certified public accountants acting personally and in their capacity as partners of the partnership Deloitte & Touche Certified Public Auditors & Accountants. 7. On an unspecified date the applicants were sued, personally and in their capacity as partners of the partnership Deloitte & Touche Certified Public Auditors & Accountants, as auditors of PCO Ltd, in a civil action by a company, V. The latter claimed that the applicants’ audit firm had acted negligently and fraudulently in its drawing up of PCO Ltd’s audit report/financial statements, and was therefore liable for the losses sustained by V as a result of its reliance on those documents. 8. During the proceedings the applicants raised a preliminary plea to the effect that reliance by V. on the audit report when taking a particular credit decision, and knowledge on the part of the applicants of such reliance when taking that decision, were lacking. These requirements were fundamental to this type of action. 9. On 1 December 2003 the Civil Court dismissed this plea in a preliminary judgment. 10. On 3 December 2003 the applicants requested special leave to appeal the preliminary judgment under Article 231 (1) of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure (“COCP”). On 12 December 2003, the Civil Court in its ordinary jurisdiction granted leave to appeal. 11. On 29 December 2003 the applicants lodged an appeal. 12. On 8 June 2004, having heard the parties’ arguments, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal as out of time. It noted that while the legislator had clearly established that the time-limit for lodging an appeal against an interlocutory decree ran from the date of authorisation to appeal, in respect of an appeal against a “judgment” the legislator had made no distinction between a “judgment” and a “partial judgment” (sentenża parżjali). It followed that the twenty-day time-limit which ran from the date of delivery of a judgment according to Article 226 (1) of the COCP applied also to appeals necessitating prior leave to appeal. 13. On 17 September 2004 the applicants instituted constitutional redress proceedings before the Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction, claiming that such an erroneous interpretation by the Court of Appeal deprived them of access to court. 14. On 15 November 2006 the Civil Court upheld the applicants’ claims, finding that a right to appeal could not arise before leave to appeal had been given. Moreover, an appellant did not have to tolerate the delays of a court in giving leave to appeal. The Court of Appeal’s interpretation had therefore deprived the applicants of access to court in violation of Article 6 of the Convention. It declared the Court of Appeal’s judgment null and void. 15. On 2 March 2007 the Constitutional Court, on appeal by the Attorney General, acknowledged that the interpretation given to the law had been erroneous, thereby depriving the applicants of their right to appeal at an early stage. Nevertheless, it did not uphold the first-instance judgment, since a wrong interpretation did not suffice to lead to a violation of the Convention. While reiterating that an appeal could be heard before the Court of Appeal only once, it considered that the applicants had the opportunity to appeal in the civil case after the final judgment. Thus, given that a defect in first-instance proceedings could be remedied on appeal, the right to a fair hearing would similarly not be violated if a remedy which had been inappropriately denied became available at a later stage of the proceedings. 16. Article 231 (1) of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure (“COCP”) (Chapter 12 of the Laws of Malta), at the relevant time, read as follows: “Where several issues in an action have been determined by separate judgments, appeal from any such judgments may only be entered after the final judgment and within the prescribed time, to be reckoned from the date of such final judgment; and in such an appeal express mention of the judgment or judgments appealed from shall be made: Provided that an appeal from such separate judgments may be entered before the final judgment only by leave of court to be read out in open court; such request for leave to appeal shall be made either orally immediately after the delivery of such judgment or by application within six days from such judgment.” 17. The Article was amended in 2005, whereby the following phrase was added to the proviso: “and when such leave to appeal from such separate judgments is granted the time for the filing of the appeal in respect thereof shall commence to run from the day on which the said leave is read out in open court.” 18. Article 226 (1) of the COCP reads as follows: “An appeal is entered by means of an application to be filed with the registry of the Court of Appeal within twenty days from the date of the judgment.”",1,834
674,674,"4. The applicant was born in 1979 and is currently detained in the Ankara Prison 5. On 23 May 1999 at about 3 p.m. the applicant, who was working for a newspaper called Kurtuluş, was taken into police custody in the district of Almus in the province of Tokat by police officers on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the DHKP/C (Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party-Front). At about 5 p.m. she was taken to the Almus State Hospital, where a medical report was issued. In the report, the presence of a 0.5 x 1 cm. abrasion under the right eye was noted. It was stated that this abrasion had probably been caused as a result of an irritation. The medical report further indicated that there were no signs of ill-treatment on her body. 6. On the same day, the applicant was transferred to the province of Tokat to be interrogated by the Anti-Terrorism Branch of the Tokat Security Directorate. Before being taken to the Security Directorate Building, at about 7.45 p.m. the applicant was sent to the Tokat State Hospital for a medical examination. The medical report indicated the presence of a hyperaemia under the right eye and an abrasion on the right side of the nose. Thereafter at about 8.10 p.m. the applicant was taken to the Tokat Maternal Hospital for a gynaecological examination with a request to establish her virginity status. As she did not give her consent, the applicant did not undergo a gynaecological examination. At 9 p.m. the applicant was taken once again to the Tokat State Hospital, this time for a rectal examination. As the applicant refused to be examined, no rectal examination was performed. 7. On 30 May 1999 before being released from custody, the applicant was taken to the Tokat Maternal Hospital for a gynaecological and rectal examination. As she did not give her consent, the doctors did not perform the examinations. Subsequently, she was taken to the Tokat State Hospital, where she was examined by a doctor. According to the doctor’s report, no signs of ill-treatment were observed on the applicant’s body. 8. On 30 May 1999 the applicant was brought before the Tokat public prosecutor. Before the public prosecutor, she denied the allegations against her and maintained that her police statement, dated 29 May 1999, had been taken under duress. She stated that she had been hosed with cold water, subjected to electric shocks and Palestinian hanging. 9. The same day the applicant was further brought before the investigating judge at the Tokat Magistrate’s Court where she repeated her statement taken by the prosecutor. The investigating judge decided to place her in detention on remand on account of the evidence in the file and the nature of the offences against her. 10. On 31 May 1999 the Tokat public prosecutor declined jurisdiction and transferred the case to the public prosecutor at the Ankara State Security Court. 11. In an indictment dated 15 June 1999, the Ankara State Security Court Public Prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant and accused her of being a member of an illegal organisation. 12. On 12 August 1999 the applicant sent a letter to the court and retracted her statement made to the police, alleging that it was taken under duress. In this letter, she explained in detail the various forms of ill-treatments she had been allegedly subjected to in custody. In particular, she maintained that during her police custody she had been stripped naked, threatened with rape, beaten, hosed with cold water, subjected to electric shocks and hung from her arms. 13. On 11 July 2000 the Ankara State Security Court found that the applicant had been continuously working for the said illegal organisation. It therefore found the applicant guilty as charged under Article 168 of the Criminal Code and sentenced her to twelve years six months’ imprisonment. 14. On 4 April 2001 the applicant submitted her appeal petition to the Court of Cassation. While challenging the decision of the first-instance court, she particularly referred to her ill-treatment under custody. She also stated that she had been taken to the hospital on two occasions during her police custody to undergo a gynaecological examination. She alleged that this treatment constituted degrading treatment. 15. On 25 April 2001 the Court of Cassation, upholding the Ankara State Security Court’s reasoning and assessment of evidence, rejected the applicant’s appeal.",1,731

The perpetrator of the accident had taken out insurance with the insurance company ZT. 7. On 30 September 1999 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against ZT in the Celje District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Celju) seeking damages in the amount of 2,257,000 tolars (approximately 9,400 euros) for the injuries sustained. Between 6 April 2000 and 16 January 2003 the applicant lodged four preliminary written submissions and/or adduced evidence. Between 6 April 2000 and 1 October 2001 he made six requests that a date be set for a hearing. During the proceedings the court appointed a medical expert. Of the three hearings held between 28 May 2002 and 25 February 2003 none was adjourned at the request of the applicant. At the last hearing the parties settled the case and the court terminated the proceedings.",1,158
684,684,"The applicant is a British national, born in 1916 and currently living in Switzerland. He is represented before the Court by Stephenson Harwood, a firm of solicitors based in London as well as by Mr J.P. Gardner, a solicitor also based in London. On 27 November 1997 the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry published a Report (“the Report”) prepared by Inspectors appointed by the Department of Trade and Industry under sections 432(2) and 442 of the Companies Act 1985 to investigate allegations of an unlawful share support operation at the time of the take-over by Guinness PLC of the Distillers Company PLC. The applicant maintains that the Report refers quite extensively to him and is pejorative, containing criticisms of his honesty both in relation to the events which are the principal subject-matter of the Report and his responses to the Inspectors. The content of the Report is seriously detrimental to his reputation, all the more so in view of the intense media interest generated by it. The applicant refers to the facts that on 11 and 16 October 1997 his lawyers submitted detailed representations to the Secretary of State urging him not to publish the Report as he had lodged an application with the European Commission on Human Rights in connection with the manner in which the Inspectors had obtained evidence from him and how that evidence was subsequently used by the prosecution at his trial. In their representations to the Secretary of State the applicant’s lawyers argued that, at the very least, publication of the Report should be deferred until the Convention institutions had adjudicated on his complaints. They requested the Secretary of State in the event of a decision to publish the Report in opposition to their representations to give them full information on the reasons for doing so.",0,303

The perpetrator of the accident had taken out insurance with the insurance company ZT. 7. On 16 December 1997 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against ZT in the Celje Local Court (Okrajno sodišče v Celju) seeking damages in the amount of 1,104,192 tolars (approximately 4,600 euros) for the injuries sustained. Between 23 March 1998 and 21 March 2001 the applicant filed seven preliminary written submissions and/or adduced evidence. From 6 September 1999 and 21 May 2001 he made six requests that a date be set for a hearing. Of the three hearings held between 6 April 2000 and 2 October 2001 none was adjourned at the request of the applicant. During the proceedings the court appointed two medical experts. The court also sought an additional opinion from one of the appointed experts. At the last hearing the court decided to deliver a written judgment. The judgment, upholding the applicant’s claim, was served on the applicant on 25 October 2001. 8. On 9 November 2001 ZT appealed to the Celje Higher Court (Višje sodišče v Celju). ZT cross-appealed. On 3 December 2002 the court dismissed the appeal. The judgment was served on the applicant on 27 December 2002. 9. On 15 January 2003 ZT lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court (Vrhovno sodišče). On 20 May 2004 the court dismissed the appeal. The judgment was served on the applicant on 21 June 2004.",1,260
688,688,"4. The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Vinnytsya. 5. On 1 June 2000 the applicant’s son was beaten to death. On 8 June 2000 the prosecutors instituted criminal proceedings against M., D., Z. and C. (“the defendants”) on suspicion of having murdered the applicant’s son. On 29 December 2000 the prosecutors issued a bill of indictment and referred the criminal case to courts. 6. According to the applicant, on 11 December 2000, in the framework of the criminal proceedings, she introduced a civil claim against the defendants for compensation and on 21 February 2003 she amended her claim by increasing the claimed compensation. Despite the Court’s request, the applicant has failed to provide a copy of her claim. In their observations, the Government submitted a copy of the applicant’s civil claim dated 21 February 2003. 7. Following the Supreme Court’s two remittals of the case for fresh consideration, on 19 June 2009 the Staromiskyy District Court of Vinnytsya found M. guilty of intentional infliction of grievous bodily injuries on the applicant’s son that led to the latter’s death and sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment. It further found C., Z. and D. guilty of hooliganism, sentenced them to various terms of restriction of liberty and discharged them because the limitation period had expired. The court also allowed the applicant’s civil claim and ordered M. and C. to pay her certain amounts in compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. 8. On 20 August 2009 the Vinnytsya Regional Court of Appeal upheld the above judgment. There is no information in the case file whether the case was further considered on cassation. 9. In the course of the proceedings, two forensic expert examinations were carried out, the hearings were 25 times adjourned due to the defendants’ lawyers’ and once due to the witnesses’ failure to attend them. The hearings were also four times adjourned due to the applicant’s and the defendants’ lawyers’ failure to attend them (which delayed the proceedings to two months approximately).",1,334
689,689,"4. The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Pskov, a town in the Pskov Region. 5. The applicant sued his employer, a regional department of the Federal Debt Recovery Centre, for salary arrears. 6. On 18 May 2004 the Pskov Town Court awarded him against the Government 342,578 Russian roubles (RUB) in respect of the arrears and RUB 20,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damages. This judgment became binding on 7 June 2004. In July and December 2004 the applicant sent enforcement papers to the Ministry of Finance, but in September 2005 the Ministry returned the papers, because they did not indicate the Ministry as the defendant and did not specify the financial source to be charged. The applicant asked the Town Court to clarify the judgment, but on 23 November 2005 the court refused this request, because the judgment was clear as it stood. The judgment has not been enforced to date. 7. In the meantime, on the Government’s request, on 12 November 2004 the Presidium of the Pskov Regional Court quashed the judgment in the part concerning the damages, and rejected this claim. The Presidium found that the courts below had misinterpreted material law. 8. On 17 April 2006 the Town Court gave two other judgments in the applicant’s favour. In the first judgment it adjusted the outstanding award of 18 May 2004 for the cost of living and awarded RUB 87,357. This judgment became binding on 28 April 2006. In the second judgment the court awarded the applicant RUB 206,672 in respect of salary arrears. This judgment became binding on 3 May 2006. In May 2006 the applicant sent enforcement papers to the Ministry of Finance, but later the same month the Ministry returned the papers, because they did not specify the financial source to be charged. The applicant sent the enforcement papers to the bailiff’s service, but in December 2006 the service returned the papers, because it was not authorised to enforce debts against the treasury. 9. Under section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997, a bailiff must enforce a judgment within two months. Under section 242.2.6 of the Budget Code of 31 July 1998, the Ministry of Finance must enforce a judgment within three months.",1,377

On 11 February 1993 the General Directorate of National Roads and Highways, expropriated plots of land belonging to the applicant in Balçova, Izmir. A committee of experts assessed the value of the plots of land belonging to the applicant and compensation was paid to him when the expropriation took place. 6. Following the applicant’s request for increased compensation, the Izmir First Instance Court awarded him additional compensation at the statutory rate of 30% per annum, namely the rate applicable at the date of the court’s decision. The date 4 August 1995 was fixed by the domestic court for the running of the statutory rate of interest. On 28 December 1998, on the General Directorate’s appeal, the Court of Cassation upheld the decision of the first instance court. On 17 May 2000 the administration paid the applicant 3,919,570,000 Turkish Liras as the additional compensation awarded to him together with interest. 7. The relevant domestic law and practice are set out in the Aka v. Turkey judgment of 23 September 1998 (Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VI, pp. 2674-76, §§ 17-25).",0,191
695,695,"6. The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Rostov-on-Don. 7. The applicant served in the military. By a judgment of 18 October 2002 the Military Court of the Vladikavkaz Garrison declared unlawful the refusal of the commander of military unit 66156 to pay the applicant additional monthly combat allowance, obliged the head of the finance department of the North Caucasus Military Circuit to allocate funds for such payment and recovered in the applicant’s favour the allowance arrears in the amount of 58,900 Russian roubles (RUB). By another judgment of 17 December 2002 the same court delivered a similar judgment and recovered additionally RUB 121,600 in favour of the applicant. 8. On 18 August 2005 the regional office of the Federal Treasury returned the writs of execution to the applicant on the ground that the military unit did not have an account there. The writs of execution were also returned by the main office of the Federal Treasury on 28 September 2005. In their letter of the same date the Federal Treasury suggested that the applicant submit the writs of execution to the bailiff service. It is not clear from the parties’ submissions whether the applicant has done so. 9. The judgments remain unenforced to date.",1,207
696,696,"The applicant, Jose Manuel de Ponte Nascimento, is a Portuguese national, who was born in 1966, and lives in Madeira. He is represented before the Court by Mr Andrew Christodoulou, a solicitor, and Mr David Williams, counsel, both practising in London. The respondent Government are represented by their agent, Ms J Foakes of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 4 June 1994, the applicant was knocked off his bicycle by a car. He started proceedings against the driver of the car on 3 June 1997. The applicant returned to live in Madeira. On 22 October 1997, the Clerkenwell County Court ordered the applicant to file further medical evidence in support of his claim within 28 days, failing which any particulars of injury not substantiated by a medical report would be struck out. Further medical evidence was filed on behalf of the applicant, some within 28 days and some later. The defendant to the proceedings made an application that the particulars of injury be struck out for failure to comply with the order of 22 October 1997. The application was heard on 29 January 1998 by District Judge Southcombe, who struck out the particulars of injury. The practical effect of striking out the particulars of injury was that the applicant could no longer claim general damages or damages for loss of earnings, which represented by far the major part of his claim. The applicant appealed against the decision of District Judge Southcombe. On 19 June 1998, the appeal was heard by Recorder Knowles. She dismissed the appeal. The applicant applied to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal. The hearing began on 15 April 1999 and continued on 22 April 1999. The Court of Appeal reserved its judgment. On 15 June 1999, the Court of Appeal handed down a judgment refusing permission to appeal. Each of the three Lord Justices of Appeal gave a separate judgment. Sir Iain Glidewell considered that the Recorder had applied the proper test and exercised her discretion correctly, and that permission to appeal should accordingly be refused. Lord Justice Clarke considered that the District Judge and the Recorder had failed to apply the relevant legal principles correctly, and that permission to appeal should be granted, because otherwise no court would have considered the exercise of its discretion on correct principles. Lord Justice Chadwick considered that the Recorder had identified the applicable principles but failed to apply them, but that this failure did not raise any question of principle within the terms of either paragraph 20 of the practice direction of 17 November 1998 or paragraph 2.19.1 of the consolidated practice direction of 26 April 1999 (see below). He further considered that the case was not one which for some other reason (practice direction of 17 November 1998), or some other compelling reason (consolidated practice direction of 26 April 1999), should be considered by the Court of Appeal. Lord Justice Chadwick stated at pp. 39-40: “Personal injury litigation should not be conducted on the basis that the rules peculiar to it can be treated as of no importance. To do so is to put at risk one of the objects which those rules are intended to promote; that is to say, that the medical evidence on which the plaintiff relies can be properly assessed by the defendant at as early a stage as possible. Failure to make early disclosure of the plaintiff’s medical condition puts a fair trial at risk. I can see no basis upon which to hold that justice demands that the defendant should suffer the risk that any trial which could now be held would be less than fair. On the contrary, it seems to me that the balance of justice lies in upholding the orders which have been made.” Lord Justice Chadwick concluded that permission to appeal should be refused. He declined to take a view on the merits which he regarded as finely balanced. On 17 November 1998, Lord Woolf, Master of the Rolls, issued a practice direction relating, inter alia, to leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal (reported at [1999] 1 Weekly Law Reports 2). Practice Directions do not have formal legal effect but are followed by the judiciary, representing as they do the collective view of senior judges and, in time, the terms of Practice Directions become embodied in decisions of the higher courts, which do have binding effect. Paragraph 10 of the practice direction provided, under the heading “The General Test for Leave”: “The general rule applied by the Court of Appeal, and thus the relevant basis for first instance courts deciding whether to grant leave, is that leave will be given unless an appeal would have no realistic prospect of success.” Paragraph 20 of the practice direction contained new guidance, in the following terms (so far as material): “Where there has already been one unsuccessful appeal to a court ... against the decision being challenged, for example from a District Judge to a Circuit Judge or from a Master to a High Court Judge, and the application is for permission for a further appeal to the Court of Appeal, a more restrictive approach to the test for permission to appeal should be adopted. Permission should be granted only if the case raises an important point of principle or practice or the case is one which for some other compelling reason should be considered by the Court of Appeal.” On 26 April 1999, the Court of Appeal issued a practice direction consolidating, with some amendments, all of the principal practice directions which applied to proceedings in the Court of Appeal (Civil Division). Paragraphs 10 and 20 of the practice direction of 17 November 1998 were reproduced in similar terms in the consolidated practice direction, with one significant change: in paragraph 20 (new paragraph 2.19.1), the word “important” was omitted from the final sentence.",0,993
698,698,"4. The applicant was born in 1945 and lives in the town of Saransk in the Mordoviya Republic. 5. In 1990 the applicant obtained a State special-purpose commodity bond (облигация государственного целевого беспроцентного займа). By its terms the Government undertook to give her a Russian-made VAZ passenger car. 6. It appears that in 1993 the applicant requested the State to comply with its obligation, but it could not be fulfilled for want of cars. 7. After the change in legislation in 1995 and 1996, the applicant became entitled to compensation in the amount equal to the car value, as described in the bond and determined in co-ordination with car manufacturers at the moment of redemption. 8. It appears that in August 1998 the applicant received partial compensation. 9. In November 1999 she sued the Government for the full market value of the car. 10. By judgment of 25 April 2002, the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Saransk awarded her 50,400 Russian roubles (RUB) against the Ministry of Finance. On 4 June 2002 the Supreme Court of the Mordoviya Republic upheld the judgment. 11. On 19 June 2002 the bailiff instituted enforcement proceedings. On 1 July 2002 the bailiff returned the writ of execution to the applicant. On the same date, the applicant re-submitted it to the Ministry of Justice. Upon the Ministry's instructions, on 17 July 2002 the applicant forwarded her writ to the Treasury Department in Moscow. 12. By letter of 26 August 2002 the Treasury returned the writ to the applicant, indicating that it should be submitted to the Ministry of Finance. The applicant sent the writ to the Ministry on 10 October 2002 13. On 6 December 2002 the Ministry informed the applicant that it would not enforce the judgment because supervisory-review proceedings had been pending. 14. The applicant received the monies due to her on 28 April 2006.",1,311

They are represented before the Court by Mr Ranko Radović, a lawyer practising in Zagreb. The respondent Government are represented by their Agent, Ms Lidija Lukina-Karajković. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The first applicant is the mother of the second applicant. On 15 December 1972 their husband and father, H.I. died in a hospital in Zagreb. On 8 November 1976 the applicants instituted civil proceedings in the Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu) against the hospital, alleging that their husband and father had died due to the hospital personnel’s negligence and sought non-pecuniary damages. Before the Convention entered into force in respect of Croatia (i.e. before 5 November 1997) the case was several times decided at different levels. After the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) quashed the first and second instance judgments on 16 November 1989, the case was remitted to the Zagreb Municipal Court as the court of first instance, which before to 5 November 1997 held three hearings. On 5 November 1997 the court invited the applicants to pay an advance for the costs of an additional medical expertise. On 25 May 1998 the Faculty of Medicine in Zagreb (Medicinski fakultet u Zagrebu) submitted its expertise to the court. On 13 July and 18 September 1998 the parties submitted their comments on the medical expertise. On 9 October 1998 the defendant filed additional submissions. At the hearing on 13 April 1999 the applicants’ counsel asked the court to adopt a partial judgment. At the hearing on 21 February 2002 the court ordered that yet another additional medical expertise be carried out. At the next hearing on 4 June 2002 the court heard two medical experts and adopted partial judgment awarding the applicants’ claim in part and rejecting it in part. On 5 July 2002 the defendant appealed against the judgment. It appears that the proceedings are presently pending before the appellate court. The relevant parts of Section 63 of the Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court (entered into force on 15 March 2002, published in the Official Gazette no. 49 of 3 May 2002 - hereinafter “the 2002 Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court” - Ustavni zakon o Ustavnom sudu Republike Hrvatske iz 2002) read as follows: (1) The Constitutional Court shall examine a constitutional complaint even before all legal remedies have been exhausted in cases when a competent court has not decided within a reasonable time a claim concerning the applicant’s rights and obligations or a criminal charge against him ... (2) If the constitutional complaint ... under paragraph 1 of this Section is accepted, the Constitutional Court shall determine a time-limit within which a competent court shall decide the case on the merits... (3) In a decision under paragraph 2 of this Article, the Constitutional Court shall fix appropriate compensation for the applicant in respect of the violation found concerning his constitutional rights ... The compensation shall be paid from the State budget within a term of three months from the date when the party lodged a request for its payment.",0,541

The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant’s wife died on 30 May 2000. On 3 September 2000, the applicant made a claim for widows’ benefits. On 5 September 2000, the applicant was informed that his claim had been disallowed as he was not a woman. On 15 September 2000 the applicant made a request for reconsideration. On 19 September 2000 his claim was reconsidered but the decision remained unchanged. On an unspecified date the applicant appealed. On 6 November 2000 the appeal tribunal confirmed the previous decision. The applicant applied for a further reconsideration and on 13 July 2001 he was advised that he was not entitled to widows’ benefits. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefit was payable to widowers under United Kingdom law.

By a decision of 15 March 1991, which was made enforceable on 19 March 1991, the Milan Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises must be vacated by 30 September 1991. 12. On 10 July 1991, the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring him to vacate the premises. 13. On 18 November 1991 she served notice on the tenant informing him that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 29 November 1991. 14. Between 29 November 1991 and 22 January 1999 the bailiff made twenty-four attempts to recover possession. Each attempt proved unsuccessful, as, under the statutory provisions providing for the staggering of evictions, the applicant was not entitled to police assistance in enforcing the order for possession. 15. On 22 November 1999, the applicant repossessed the premises with the assistance of the police. 16. The relevant domestic law is described in the Court’s judgment in the case of Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, 28.7.99, §§ 18-35, ECHR 1999-V.",1,240
705,705,"7. The applicant was born in 1948 and is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment in HMP Verne. 8. The applicant owned a garage in Dorset and had business connections in Spain. He had two Mercedes cars each of which had a false compartment in the fuel tank. The false compartments could hold up to 45 kilograms of cannabis resin. From 1994 he was suspected by the police of being involved in drug trafficking. The police also suspected him of being involved in the handling of stolen goods, including stolen vehicles. 9. On 22 February 1995 he was arrested by the Dorset police in relation to their suspicions of his handling stolen goods. Whilst he was in custody, a listening device was installed at his garage premises which remained there and active until 26 July 1995 when it was discovered. 10. On 30 December 1996 an indictment was signed charging the applicant with conspiracy to import controlled drugs and conspiracy to supply controlled drugs, namely cannabis. The prosecution evidence against the applicant relied on tape recordings made from the listening device which had been installed by the police at the applicant’s garage premises. It was acknowledged by the prosecution that without the evidence from the tapes, there was no prima facie case against the applicant. 11. The applicant objected to the admission of the tape recordings as evidence in his trial. He argued inter alia that the original grant of authority and the renewal of authority for the placement of the listening device were not in compliance with the Home Office Guidelines, which governed the use of surveillance equipment by the police at the relevant time. He submitted that his prosecution ought to be stayed as an abuse of the process of the court, alternatively the tape evidence should be excluded under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (“PACE”). 12. A preliminary hearing was held on the matter of the admissibility of the tape recordings. His Honour Judge Pryor QC held on 8 July 1997 that he was satisfied that the original authority for the use of the surveillance equipment was properly granted and that there were proper grounds for renewal, though he made some criticism of the lack of documentation on the renewals and noted that there had been a technical infringement in that one renewal took place a day late. The judge concluded that the tapes were admissible as evidence and should not be excluded under section 78 of PACE. 13. Following the admission of the tapes as evidence, the applicant pleaded guilty to the charges of conspiracy to import controlled drugs and conspiracy to supply controlled drugs, namely cannabis. On 5 September 1997 he was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. 14. The applicant was granted leave to appeal against his conviction. On 24 September 1997, the Court of Appeal held that in the light of the applicant’s pleas of guilty his convictions could not be regarded as “unsafe” and rejected his appeal. 15. Guidelines on the use of equipment in police surveillance operations (The Home Office Guidelines of 1984) provided that only chief constables or assistant chief constables were entitled to give authority for the use of such devices. The Guidelines were available in the library of the House of Commons and were disclosed by the Home Office on application. 16. In each case, the authorising officer had to satisfy himself that the following criteria were met: a) the investigation concerned serious crime; b) normal methods of investigation must have been tried and failed, or must from the nature of things, have been unlikely to succeed if tried; c) there was good reason to think that use of the equipment would be likely to lead to an arrest and a conviction, or where appropriate, to the prevention of acts of terrorism; d) the use of equipment was operationally feasible. The authorising officer had also to satisfy himself that the degree of intrusion into the privacy of those affected by the surveillance was commensurate with the seriousness of the offence. 17. The 1997 Act provides a statutory basis for the authorisation of police surveillance operations involving interference with property or wireless telegraphy. The relevant sections relating to the authorisation of surveillance operations, including the procedures to be adopted in the authorisation process, entered into force on 22 February 1998. 18. Since 25 September 2000, these controls have been augmented by Part II of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (“RIPA”). In particular, covert surveillance in a police cell is now governed by sections 26(3) and 48(1) of RIPA. RIPA also establishes a statutory Investigatory Powers Tribunal to deal with complaints about intrusive surveillance and the use of informants by the police.",1,788
709,709,"4. The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Somlóvásárhely, Hungary. 5. On 6 May 1993 the applicant's wife requested the Ajka District Court to hold a preliminary hearing with a view to instituting divorce proceedings. In turn, on 7 July 1993 the applicant brought an action before the District Court claiming maintenance for the couple's son, who was at the time in the applicant's care. The District Court held hearings on the maintenance claim on 13 September and 3 November 1993. On the latter date the applicant's wife formally filed for divorce. The divorce proceedings were subsequently joined to the claim for maintenance. 6. In the joined proceedings, hearings took place on 27 April, 17 June, 16 September and 31 October 1994, 3 February and 5 April 1995. 7. On the latter date the District Court pronounced, in a partial decision, the couple's divorce. In line with the parties' agreement, it granted the mother custody of their son. The court ordered the applicant to pay maintenance, regulated his right of access to the boy and ordered the parties to share the use of their flat which was in common ownership. The court relied on the testimonies of numerous witnesses, including a social worker, the applicant's two step-children born out of the mother's previous marriage, and the couple's son. 8. On the applicant's appeal of 12 May 1995, the Veszprém County Regional Court held a hearing on 26 September 1995. At a hearing on 10 October 1995 the Regional Court allowed the applicant's appeal and amended the District Court's decision in the part concerning the amount of maintenance and the details of his access rights. 9. On 13 December 1995 the proceedings were resumed before the District Court in respect of the division of the matrimonial property. A hearing was held on 13 December 1995. A further hearing took place on 21 February 1996. On the latter date the District Court decided to obtain various expert opinions. 10. On 31 May and 23 July 1996, respectively, property and valuation experts submitted their opinions. 11. At a hearing on 18 October 1996 the District Court appointed a motor-vehicle expert to prepare an opinion. On 12 December 1996 the expert was urged to submit his opinion. On 31 December 1996 the expert informed the court that the applicant could not be located at the address notified to him. On 17 February 1997 the expert was requested to submit an opinion as soon as possible. On 27 February 1997 the expert submitted his opinion. 12. Further hearings were held on 28 April, 12 May and 17 November 1997. Meanwhile, on 6 June 1997 the applicant requested further expert evidence to be taken. Although it experienced difficulties in finding an expert jeweller, the District Court finally appointed one on 27 February 1998 and requested the parties to contact him. On 30 July 1998 the expert submitted his opinion. 13. On 28 September 1998 an expert psychologist submitted his opinion. A hearing scheduled for 28 October 1998 was adjourned at the applicant's request. 14. The next hearing took place on 20 January 1999. The District Court ordered the property expert to complete his opinion of 31 May 1996, taking into account any possible changes which might have occurred in the meantime. On 19 March 1999 the District Court requested the expert to proceed as a matter of urgency. On 24 March 1999 the expert submitted his opinion, which was based on an on-site inspection of the property. 15. Further hearings took place on 27 September and 25 October 1999. On the latter date both the applicant and his representative failed to appear before the court. Meanwhile, the District Court made enquiries with the parties' bank as regards the mortgage situation of their flat. On 29 October 1999 the court requested the parties to waive their rights to secrecy in respect of their bank details. The waivers were sent to the bank on 17 November 1999. On 28 December 1999 the District Court made a further enquiry with the bank as regards payments transferred from the parties' bank account to cover housing expenses. On 24 January 2000 the District Court ordered the applicant to submit his waiver in the form required by the bank. The bank submitted the requested banking details on 27 March 2000. 16. At the hearings of April and 22 May 2000 several witnesses were heard on the use of the parties' flat. On the latter date the District Court carried out an inspection of the flat. 17. On 13 December 2000 the District Court ruled on the division of the matrimonial property. On 20 and 27 December 2000, respectively, the applicant and the defendant appealed. 18. The Veszprém County Regional Court held hearings on 20 February, 1 and 20 March 2001. During this period the parties were involved in negotiations aimed at reaching an agreement on the sale of their flat. On the parties' joint request of 28 March 2001, the Regional Court discontinued the proceedings on 3 April 2001 and annulled the decision of 13 December 2000.",1,847
712,712,"6. The following facts were established in the principal judgment: “38. According to the applicant's representative before the Court, the applicant had been refused permission to be represented by his privately retained counsel but legal-aid counsel had been appointed instead. Neither the applicant's representative nor his family members had been informed of the exact place of his detention in Uzbekistan. 39. The applicant's representative before the Court wrote to the Uzbek Prosecutor General's Office asking for information regarding the place of the applicant's detention and the conditions of access to him. Her request was forwarded to the prosecutor in the Surkhandaryinsk Region of Uzbekistan. On 17 January 2007 the prosecutor forwarded the request to the Surkhandaryinsk Regional Court. The applicant's representative also wrote to the Uzbek Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. No replies were received. 40. On an unspecified date, the Russian authorities sent a request concerning the applicant to the Uzbek authorities. On 6 March 2007 the Uzbek Ministry of the Interior replied and enclosed a letter in Russian from the applicant dated 20 December 2006 worded as follows: “... during my arrest and detention ... the police and other law-enforcement officers did not violate my rights and did not exert any physical pressure upon me. I have no claims against the police officers in Moscow or Lipetsk or against any other law-enforcement authority in Russia. I confirm that this declaration is correct and written with my own hand.” 41. According to a linguistic expert report, produced by the applicant's representative, the above letter did not contain any significant mistakes, whereas the applicant's personal letters contained numerous mistakes reflecting his Uzbek mother tongue's phonetics and grammar. The expert noted that the applicant would not have been able to acquire a sufficient command of the Russian language during the three months between the date of his sample letters (September 2006) and the letter in question (December 2006). The expert concluded that the letter of 20 December 2006 had not been written spontaneously by the applicant, who had transcribed the text from the original or written it from a letter-by-letter dictation by someone else.” 7. Following the adoption of the principal judgment by the Court, by a letter of 9 July 2009 the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation replied to a request from the applicant's representative before the Court. The Prosecutor General's Office stated that all matters relating to the execution by the applicant of the prison term imposed by an Uzbek court in 2007 were within the exclusive competence of the Uzbek authorities; the applicant's representative thus had to apply directly to those authorities. 8. By a letter of 17 July 2009, the Office of the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights indicated to the applicant's representative that any correspondence between the national authorities and the applicant's representative on procedural matters should be carried out through the European Court. Thus, the representative was directed to address all her queries to the Court.",0,505
716,716,"4. The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Gdańsk, Poland. 5. On 16 July 2004 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of robbery. On 17 July 2004 the Gdańsk District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody until 16 October 2004. It found that there were reasonable grounds – in particular, evidence from witnesses – for suspecting him of the offence charged. The court further noted that the applicant was liable to a statutory maximum sentence of at least 12 years’ imprisonment. It also found that there was a risk that the applicant might tamper with evidence. 6. On 11 October 2004 the Gdańsk District Court prolonged the applicant’s detention until 16 January 2005. It considered that the reasons for keeping him in detention were still valid and the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation justified holding him in custody. It referred to the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on the applicant. It also found that there was a risk that the applicant might tamper with evidence, given the nature of the charges against him and the fact that he had acted with other co-accused. 7. The applicant’s detention was subsequently prolonged by the District Court on unspecified dates. The courts’ decisions were based on Article 258 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which lists grounds for pre-trial detention, such as, the risk that an accused will abscond or go into hiding or a justified fear that an accused will attempt to induce witnesses or co-defendants to give false testimony or to obstruct the proper course of proceedings by any other unlawful means. 8. On 27 October 2005 the Gdańsk District Court convicted the applicant of two counts of robbery and sentenced him to 3 years and 6 months’ imprisonment. The applicant appealed. 9. On 26 September 2006 the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) upheld the impugned judgment. 10. The applicant did not lodge a cassation appeal. 11. The applicant’s letter to the Court dated 24 November 2004 bears a stamp marked “censored” (cenzurowano), “the prosecutor” (prokurator) followed by an illegible signature. It appears that the envelope in which that letter was sent had been cut open and subsequently resealed with adhesive tape. According to the postmark the letter was posted on 8 December 2004. 12. The application form submitted by the applicant and dated 13 January 2005 bears a stamp marked “censored” (cenzurowano), “the judge” (sędzia) followed by an illegible signature. The envelope bears a stamp confirming that the applicant’s letter was received for dispatch by the prison administration on 18 January 2005. However, according to the postmark the letter was not posted until 31 January 2005. It also appears that the envelope was cut open and subsequently resealed with adhesive tape. 13. The relevant domestic law concerning the censorship of prisoners’ correspondence is set out in the Court’s judgment in the case of Michta v. Poland, no. 13425/02, §§ 33-39, 4 May 2006.",1,500
719,719,"5. The applicant was born in 1982 and lives in Kicevo. 6. At 11.30 a.m. on 12 February 2009 the applicant was arrested and taken into police custody. On 13 February 2009 an investigating judge from the Gostivar Court of First Instance (“the trial court”) questioned the applicant, who was assisted by counsel. An investigation was opened on the grounds of reasonable suspicion of extortion of money from a minor. The investigating judge refused a request by the public prosecutor for the applicant to be detained in prison, but ordered, instead, thirty days' house arrest (куќен притвор). That measure required the applicant to remain at home and to refrain from using any means of communication for the duration of the order. His passport was also seized and the police were ordered to check his presence in the house twice a day. The judge considered that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting the applicant of having committed the offence, but that in the light of his clean record and family circumstances, a non-custodial measure, such as house arrest, was preferable. The applicant's house arrest was ordered on all the grounds specified in section 199 of the Criminal Proceedings Act (see paragraph 14 below). This decision was served on the applicant and his lawyer at 5 p.m. 7. At 7 p.m. the same day, the public prosecutor appealed on the ground that the investigating judge had not provided sufficient reasons for refusing to detain the applicant in prison and had not examined whether house arrest could be supervised effectively. The applicant did not appeal. 8. On 14 February 2009 a three-judge panel of the trial court (“the panel”), sitting in private, allowed the appeal and replaced the order for the applicant's house arrest with an order for his detention in prison. It further quashed the order for the confiscation of the applicant's passport. The panel found that there was a danger that the applicant would interfere with the investigation, in particular by putting pressure on witnesses who had not been heard yet and on the victim, who, being a minor, was vulnerable. Having regard to the gravity of the offence and the way in which it had been committed, the panel ruled that house arrest was an inadequate measure in the applicant's case. This decision was served on the applicant at noon. No appeal lay against the panel's decision. 9. On 26 February 2009 the investigating judge terminated the panels' order for the applicant's detention in prison and ordered thirty days' house arrest accompanied by the same security measures described above (see paragraph 6 above). The judge found no justification for the applicant's continued detention in prison since the investigation had been completed. In this connection, he noted that evidence had been taken from the victim and witnesses proposed by both parties. Given the accompanying measures ordered, there was no likelihood of reoffending or obstructing the course of justice by influencing other witnesses, if any. 10. On 27 February 2009 the panel dismissed the public prosecutor's appeal, finding the house arrest and accompanying measures adequate to ensure the applicant's attendance at the trial. 11. The panel, sitting in first instance, extended the applicant's house arrest on two occasions, namely, on 26 March and 24 April 2009, with the stated aim of ensuring his attendance at trial. In doing so, it relied on the gravity of the charges and potential penalty. The applicant unsuccessfully appealed against both orders. The Gostivar Court of Appeal's decisions dismissing the applicant's appeals dated 23 April and 20 May 2009 respectively. 12. On 21 May 2009 the trial court convicted the applicant of extortion and sentenced him to one and a half years' imprisonment. It further extended the house arrest order until the criminal proceedings are completed. The proceedings are underway. 13. Section 22(6) of the Criminal Proceedings Act (“the Act”) provides that a three-judge panel of the trial court decides, inter alia, appeals against decisions of the investigating judge. 14. Under section 199(1), paragraphs 1-3, of the Act, pre-trial detention can be ordered on reasonable suspicion that the person concerned has committed an offence if there is a risk of his or her absconding, interfering with the investigation or reoffending. 15. Under section 200(1), (6) and (8) of the Act, an investigating judge has jurisdiction to order pre-trial detention. The detainee may challenge the detention order before the panel within 24 hours. The appeal does not suspend the execution of the detention order. The panel must decide the appeal within 48 hours. The detainee, through his or her lawyer, can request to be notified of the date of the hearing before the panel in order to be able to present his or her arguments orally. 16. Section 205(2) and (6) of the Act provides that the panel, set up under section 22(6), may extend the period of detention by up to 60 days at the request of the investigating judge. Such an order can be challenged before the next level of jurisdiction.",1,835
726,726,"The applicant, Mrs Lyubov Yevgenyevna Kuznetsova, is a Russian national who was born in 1957 and lives in Volgograd. The Russian Government were represented by Mr P. Laptev, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant purchased a flat from a private company. It subsequently transpired that the flat was under charge. On 6 October 1999 and 9 March 2000 the Commercial Court of the Volgograd Region declared the sale of the flat to the applicant void ab initio and transferred the title to it to a Mrs S. On 31 May 2000 the applicant sued the original seller, claiming recognition of her title to the flat. By judgment of 28 June 2000 the Krasnooktyabrskiy District Court of Volgograd accepted her claim. This judgment became final. On 3 October 2000 it was set aside because the judgment of 9 March 2000 had not been taken into account, and the proceedings resumed. Having re-examined the applicant’s claim against the original seller, on 26 December 2000 the District Court discontinued the proceedings for lack of jurisdiction. On 31 May 2001 the Presidium of the Volgograd Regional Court re-opened the proceedings by way of supervisory review. On 13 July 2001 the District Court issued a new decision discontinuing the proceedings, which was again quashed by way of supervisory review on 24 August 2001 for similar reasons. Between 8 October 2001 and 22 January 2002, and then between 18 February and 27 March 2002 the proceedings were either adjourned or stayed upon the applicant’s requests. On 4 April 2002 the Krasnooktyabrskiy District Court rejected the applicant’s claim for recognition as a good faith purchaser of the flat. The applicant appealed to the Volgograd Regional Court. After she had complied with the formal requirements, her appeal was scheduled for hearing. On 25 September 2002 its examination was adjourned until 9 October 2002 due to the applicant’s illness. On 9 October 2002 the Volgograd Regional Court quashed the judgment of 4 April 2002 and remitted the case for a re-examination. It found that the District Court had failed to examine some of the applicant’ In November and December 2002 and January 2003 the proceedings were stayed at the other party’ requests. The applicant did not challenge these suspensions of the proceedings. By judgment of 12 March 2003 the Krasnooktyabrskiy District Court dismissed again the applicant’s claim. On 25 March and 23 May 2003 the judgment was rectified. On 30 July 2003 the Volgograd Regional Court quashed the judgment and remitted the matter to the district court for a fresh decision. The proceedings were stayed on 30 September until 28 November 2003 due to Mrs S.’s illness. The hearings scheduled for 25 February and 3 March 2004 were adjourned because the presiding judge T. was involved in another case or had a meeting in the town hall. On 31 March 2004 the Krasnooktyabrskiy District Court stayed the proceedings at the other party’s request. On 11 August 2004 the Volgograd Regional Court quashed that decision. On 3 September 2004 the District Court rejected as unfounded the applicant’s bias complaint in respect of judge T. and adjourned the hearing at the other party’s request. By judgment of 9 September 2004 the Krasnooktyabrskiy District Court declared the sale of the flat void ab initio and ordered the respondent company to pay 405,935 Russian roubles to the applicant. The Volgograd Regional Court upheld that judgment on 3 February 2005. In a litigation between the original seller and third persons, including Mrs S., on 8 December 2000 the Krasnooktyabrskiy District Court upheld Mrs S.’s title to the flat. The court refused to process the applicant’s appeal against the judgment on the ground that she had no standing in those proceedings. Apparently, the applicant did not appeal against this refusal.",0,648
728,728,"The applicant is a British citizen born in 1968 and currently residing in Chelsea, London. In the proceedings before the Court she is represented by Mr Bulathwela of Antons, solicitors of Haringay, London. The facts of the case, as they have been submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows: The applicant was born in the United Kingdom and has lived there all her life. The applicant met her husband, Craig Mitchell a Jamaican citizen, in November 1991 and started to cohabit shortly after that date. On 6 November 1991, Mr Mitchell had been admitted to the United Kingdom as a visitor for 6 months subject to a condition prohibiting employment. Mr Mitchell did not seek to regularise his stay in the United Kingdom. His status was discovered when he was acquitted on drugs charges on 28 April 1993. At this time, Mr Mitchell admitted to immigration officers that he had undertaken casual labouring work and that he knew he had overstayed his leave to remain. He was served with a notice of intention to deport and detained. He was released on bail on 24 May 1993. On 2 July 1993 the applicant and Mr Mitchell married and on 27 March 1994 their daughter was born. Mr Mitchell’s appeal against the decision to deport was dismissed on 16 August 1993 and he was refused leave to appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal on 28 October 1993. In 1993 the applicant’s previous solicitors applied, on Mr Mitchell’s behalf, to the Home Office to grant him further leave on the basis of his marriage to the applicant or in the alternative on the basis of their cohabitation. Immigration officers called at the applicant’s home to investigate if the marriage was genuine and discovered that Mr Mitchell had been arrested on 5 November 1994 for drug dealing. On 3 April 1995, Mr Mitchell was sentenced to 5 years’ imprisonment for possession with intent to supply crack cocaine. In the immigration service marriage questionnaire the applicant stated that she would accompany Mr Mitchell if he was deported. The applicant says that she and her daughter visited Mr Mitchell every fortnight since his conviction and maintained regular phone contact. On 5 October 1995, the Secretary of State signed a deportation order against Mr Mitchell. In February 1997, the applicant’s solicitors asked the Home Office to revoke the deportation order and to grant Mr Mitchell leave to stay. On 28 April 1997, the Secretary of State refused. On 8 September 1997, the Secretary of State confirmed that Mr Mitchell would be deported on his release on parole on 25 September 1997. By this time, the applicant was expecting her second child in October 1997. The applicant’s solicitors sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Home Office decision but the High Court refused on 18 September 1997. A revised decision dated 5 December 1997 from the Secretary of State stated: ""insufficient evidence has been produced to substantiate the claim that a common-law relationship akin to a marriage has subsisted since November 1991, or at any time prior to the initiation of deportation proceedings against Mr Mitchell. ... as <the applicant> and the children of the marriage will be given the opportunity of accompanying Mr Mitchell on deportation, at public expense if necessary, the Secretary of State is of the view that any interference with family life would be minimal and would be justifiable when set against the need to maintain an effective immigration control."" The Court of Appeal refused leave to apply for judicial review on 15 December 1997. Mr Mitchell was deported to Jamaica on 19 December 1997.",0,605
732,732,"The applicant is a Municipal Council of a suburb of Athens. It is represented before the Court by Mr N. Frangakis, a lawyer practising in Athens. In 1985, the Municipal Council constructed five tennis courts, a warehouse, a dressing-room and a small bar in an area owned by it. In 1992, it enlarged the site and transferred it to the Tennis Club of Glyfada. By decision no. 406/1992 which altered the development plan in this area, the Municipal Council invited the Pireus Prefecture to designate the area as a green and sports area. The Pireus Prefecture did so by decision no. 10976/1993 of 9 August 1993. On 1 October 1993, a number of residents of Glyfada applied to the Supreme Administrative Court for judicial review of decisions nos.406/1992 and 10976/1993. The application was directed against the Minister of Environment, Town Planning and Public Works. On 11 September 1995, the Municipal Council intervened in the proceedings in favour of the Minister. The hearing took place on 5 June 1996 and the judgment delivered on 29 June 1998.",0,176
738,738,"4. The applicant, who was born in 1980, currently resides in Switzerland. 5. On 28 March 1998 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation. On 2 April 1998 he was placed in detention on remand. 6. On 15 April 1998 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicant, charging him under Articles 168 (2), 497 (2), 522, 55 (3), 33 and 40 of the former Criminal Code with membership of an illegal organisation and armed robbery. 7. On 28 March 2001 the Istanbul State Security Court convicted the applicant under Articles 168 (2) and 497 (2) of the former Criminal Code, and sentenced him to eight years and four months' imprisonment for the former offence and to eleven years and eight months' imprisonment for the latter offence. The State Security Court further stated that the provisions of Law no. 4616, which governed conditional release, the suspension of proceedings and the execution of sentences in respect of certain offences committed before 23 April 1999, had to be taken into account in the execution of the sentence in relation to the offence under Article 497 (2). 8. On an unspecified date the applicant appealed against the judgment of the Istanbul State Security Court. The public prosecutor did not lodge an appeal. 9. On 29 April 2002 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the Istanbul State Security Court, finding that the classification of the applicant's offence had been erroneous. The Court of Cassation further held that the applicant's acquired rights in his former conviction by the decision dated 28 March 2001 had to be safeguarded in the new judgment which would be rendered by the Istanbul State Security Court. 10. The applicant was consequently tried afresh before the Istanbul State Security Court. On 24 January 2003 the Istanbul State Security Court convicted the applicant under Article 146 (1) of the former Criminal Code for attempting to undermine the constitutional order and sentenced him to sixteen years and eight months' imprisonment. The State Security Court stated in its judgment that the applicant's acquired rights had been observed because in the first judgment the applicant had been sentenced to a total of twenty years' imprisonment, whereas in the new judgment the sentence was reduced. 11. On 22 October 2003 the applicant appealed against this judgment arguing, inter alia, that his acquired rights had not been protected. He maintained that, although the sentence imposed by the Istanbul State Security Court in its second judgment had been lower than that originally imposed, under the latter he would have been conditionally released pursuant to Law no. 4616 after ten years, thus actually serving a shorter sentence. 12. On 2 December 2003 the Court of Cassation upheld the reasoning in the judgment of the Istanbul State Security Court, and dismissed the appeal. 13. Following the entry into force of the new Criminal Code on 1 June 2005, the Istanbul Assize Court reopened the proceedings against the applicant in order to review his sentence, pursuant to the provisions of the new Criminal Code. As an interim measure, on 11 October 2005 the applicant was conditionally released pending the outcome of the proceedings. On 22 December 2006 the Istanbul Assize Court found that the provisions of the former criminal code were more favourable to the applicant and therefore decided not to apply the provisions of the new Criminal Code. On 13 November 2007 the Court of Cassation rejected the applicant's appeal. In the meantime, following his release, the applicant fled to Switzerland, where he currently resides. 14. Section 1 (2) of Law no. 4616, stipulates, inter alia, that persons who were serving their prison sentences following a conviction in respect of crimes committed before 23 April 1999 were entitled to a ten year reduction in their total sentence under the relevant execution regulations. Section 1 (5) of this Law states that the provisions of Article 1 are not applicable to, inter alia, Articles 146 and 168 of the former Criminal Code. 15. Article 326 (4) of the former Code of Criminal Procedure stipulates that, upon an appeal lodged solely by the accused, or by the prosecutor for the benefit of the accused, the new judgment may not impose a sentence which is more severe than that which was imposed originally.",0,728
739,739,"4. The applicant was born in 1934 and lives in Baia Mare. 5. On 1 April 2002 the Maramureş County Court ordered a company I.W., the applicant’s former employer, to reinstate him in his post and to pay him compensation. This decision became final. However, on 30 September 2002 the same court granted I.W.’s request and annulled the 1 April 2002 decision (contestaţie în anulare). It proceeded to re-examine the case and dismiss the applicant’s initial action. The 30 September 2002 decision was drafted on 28 October 2002 and typed up on 30 October 2002. In accordance with the rules of procedure, it was not served on the parties. 6. On 18 December 2002 the applicant requested the Procurator-General to lodge an application with the Supreme Court of Justice for an audit setting aside the decision of 30 September 2002 (recurs în anulare). On 20 March 2003, the Procurator-General refused to act upon the applicant’s request. 7. In a decision of 3 February 2000, which was upheld by a final decision of the Maramureş County Court on 18 May 2000, the applicant’s previous employer, a company called M. was ordered to give the applicant his employment record and to pay him 100,000 Old Romanian Lei (ROL) in legal fees. 8. On an unspecified date, the applicant lodged an application with the Baia Mare District Court to enforce that decision. In its defence, M. claimed that it no longer had the applicant’s employment record and that only the most recent employer (I.W.) was allowed to deliver a duplicate. 9. On 15 February 2002 the application was dismissed. The court found, in particular, that the facts of the case confirmed that it was objectively impossible for M. to deliver the applicant’s employment record, as the document was no longer in its possession. 10. The applicant’s appeal was allowed by the Maramureş County Court in a final decision of 17 June 2002, as amended on 12 September 2002. The court imposed a daily penalty on M. of ROL 350,000 from 3 February 2000 until execution and ordered it to pay the applicant ROL 5,712,000 in legal fees. After noting the arguments used by the court at firstinstance in order to find in favour of the debtor, the appeal court stated, in particular, that: “In so far as an irrevocable decision ordered [M.] to deliver to the complainant his employment record, the impediments to compliance referred to by the first-instance court are irrelevant.” 11. On 10 March 2003 M. filed with the Maramureş County Court a request for the annulment (contestaţie în anulare) of the decision of 17 June 2002, on the ground that the County Court had not examined the evidence confirming its inability to comply. 12. The applicant submitted that M. did not have locus standi to request an annulment, since the extraordinary-appeal procedure was only available to the party who had lodged the ordinary appeal. He also contended that the request should be rejected since M. had invoked the same reasons as before the first-instance court and the appeal court. 13. In a final decision of 26 March 2003, the Maramureş County Court, sitting in a different composition from that of 17 June 2002, allowed the request, and quashed the final decision of 17 June 2002 on the merits and the decision of 12 September 2002 amending it. Consequently, it dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the judgment of 15 February 2002. The relevant parts of the decision read as follows: “The request [for annulment] was lodged by [M.], which was the respondent in the appeal proceedings, within the time-limits set out in Article 313 of the Code of Civil Procedure... The court considers that Article 318 of the Code of Civil Procedure is applicable, as the appeal court committed a material error, that is, an obvious material error made by omitting important elements or information from the file which had an influence on the solution adopted. When examining the grounds for appeal, the court should have taken into account the evidence, that is, all elements that confirmed the inability to comply, namely the lack of the applicant’s employment record. The court’s conclusion that those impediments are irrelevant contradicts the evidence.” 14. Article 318 of the Code of Civil Procedure defines a “material error” as one of the grounds for having a final decision quashed by means of a request for annulment (contestaţie în anulare). This Article reads as follows, in so far as relevant: “Decisions rendered by a court of last instance may also be contested by means of a request for annulment, when the decision was based on a material error...”",1,772
743,743,"7. The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Hamburg (Germany). 8. On 8 September 1992 a Mr S. was fatally injured by a shot fired at a Gypsy encampment in Rome. The initial statements taken by the police from witnesses indicated that the applicant had been responsible for the killing. 9. On 15 October 1992 the Rome investigating judge made an order for the applicant's detention pending trial. However, the order could not be enforced as the applicant had become untraceable. As a result, the Italian authorities considered that he had deliberately evaded justice and on 14 November 1992 declared him to be a “fugitive” (latitante). The applicant was identified as Cloce (or Kroce) Sejdovic (or Sajdovic), probably born in Titograd on 5 August 1972, the son of Jusuf Sejdovic (or Sajdovic) and the brother of Zaim (ou Zain) Sejdovic (or Sajdovic). 10. As the Italian authorities had not managed to contact the applicant to invite him to select his own defence counsel, they assigned him a lawyer, who was informed that his client and four other persons had been committed for trial on a specified date in the Rome Assize Court. 11. The lawyer attended the hearing, but the applicant did not. 12. In a judgment of 2 July 1996, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 30 September 1996, the Rome Assize Court convicted the applicant of manslaughter and illegally carrying a weapon and sentenced him to twenty-one years and eight months' imprisonment. One of the applicant's co-defendants was sentenced to fifteen years and eight months' imprisonment for the same offences, while the three others were acquitted. 13. The applicant's lawyer was informed that the Assize Court's judgment had been deposited with the registry. He decided not to avail himself of his right of appeal under Italian law. The applicant's conviction accordingly became final on 22 January 1997. 14. On 22 September 1999 the applicant was arrested in Hamburg by the German police under an arrest warrant issued by the Rome public prosecutor's office. On 30 September 1999 the Italian Minister of Justice requested the applicant's extradition. He added that, once he had been extradited to Italy, the applicant would be entitled to apply under Article 175 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCP”) for leave to appeal out of time against the Rome Assize Court's judgment. 15. At the request of the German authorities, the Rome public prosecutor's office stated that it did not appear from the evidence that the applicant had been officially notified of the charges against him. The public prosecutor's office was not in a position to say whether the applicant had contacted the lawyer assigned to represent him. In any event, the lawyer had attended the hearing and had played an active role in conducting his client's defence, having called a large number of witnesses. Furthermore, the Rome Assize Court had clearly established that the applicant, who had been identified by numerous witness as Mr S.'s killer, was guilty. In the opinion of the public prosecutor's office, the applicant had absconded immediately after Mr S.'s death precisely to avoid being arrested and tried. Lastly, the public prosecutor's office stated: “A person who is to be extradited may seek leave to appeal against the judgment. However, for a court to agree to re-examine the case it has to be proved that the accused was wrongly deemed to be a 'fugitive'. To sum up, a new trial, even in the form of an appeal (during which new evidence may be submitted), is not granted automatically.” 16. On 6 December 1999 the German authorities refused the Italian Government's extradition request on the ground that the requesting country's domestic legislation did not guarantee with sufficient certainty that the applicant would have the opportunity of having his trial reopened. 17. In the meantime, the applicant had been released on 22 November 1999. 18. The relevant parts of Article 175 §§ 2 and 3 of the CCP provide: “A person convicted in absentia ... may apply for leave to appeal out of time against the judgment where he is able to prove that he was not effectively notified [of the judgment] ... [and] on condition that there has been no negligence on his part or, if the judgment delivered in absentia has been served ... on his lawyer ..., that he has not deliberately refused to apprise himself of the steps taken in the proceedings. An application for leave to appeal out of time must be lodged within ten days of the date ... on which the accused learned [of the judgment], failing which it shall be inadmissible.”",1,775
744,744,"The applicant, Mr Vladimir Vitalyevich Golubev, is a Russian national who was born in 1972 and lives in Krasnoye-Na-Volge. In 2000 the applicant, a police officer at that time, was charged with bribe taking. He was suspected in providing “protection” to a group of black market dealers in return for regular payments. On 7 July 2000 he was arrested and, since he was a former policeman, placed in a special detention facility for former law enforcement officials. On 20 May 2000 he was transferred for several days to a “common” cell where ordinary criminal suspects were detained. In his words, the investigator placed him in that cell in order to put pressure on him. On 12 September 2000 the applicant complained about this fact to the prosecution authorities. On 23 October 2000 the local prosecutor informed the applicant that the person responsible for placing him in that cell was reprimanded. There is no information on any further development regarding this complaint. On 12 October 2001 the applicant was convicted of bribe taking by the Kostroma Regional Court. He was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment in a colony of the strict regime. The applicant indicates that he was unable to study the record of the trial hearings. He indicates that he signed a waiver where he renounced his right to examine the record. He claims, however, that he did so under the pressure of the judge. The applicant and his lawyers appealed. They challenged the findings of the first instance court as to the facts of the case and complained of misinterpretation of the domestic law and various irregularities in the proceedings during the investigation and before the first instance court. The defence indicated inter alia that in the course of the pre-trial detention the applicant had been placed in a common cell, in breach of the relevant provisions of the domestic law. However, the brief of appeal did not mention that the applicant had been unable to study the trial record. The applicant did not request his personal presence at the hearing before the court of appeal. On 18 March 2002 the applicant’s conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court of Russia. The applicant was not present at the court of appeal’s hearing and remained in the detention centre. However, his two lawyers were in the courtroom and during the hearing the applicant was able to communicate with the judges through a video communication system, which allowed him to see and hear what happened in the court room, and put questions to the participants of the hearing. The Supreme Court, basing on the materials of the case-file and the parties’ pleadings, upheld the finding of the lower court in full. It did not detect any serious irregularity in the proceedings before the trial court which would require the review of the case. After conviction the applicant was sent to serve his sentence in a correctional colony in Mordovia. In 2004, due to the changes in the Criminal Code, the applicant’s sentence was reduced to four years and eleven months, and he was transferred to a colony with a milder regime. Article 375 of the Code of Criminal Proceedings of 1960, as in force at the relevant time, provided that the criminal defendant should indicate in his points of appeal whether or not he wanted to participate personally in the hearing before the court of appeal. Article 335 of that Code provided that the court of appeal might choose whether or not the applicant should participate in the hearings. However, by Ruling of 10 December 1998 no. 27-П the Constitutional Court of Russia invalidated that provision as anticonstitutional. The Constitutional Court found that the criminal defendant should always have the possibility to participate in the proceedings before the court of appeal. However, the Constitutional Court did not specify whether personal participation was needed, or participation through a video communication system was sufficient. The new Code of Criminal Proceedings, as in force from 1 July 2002, provides that the criminal defendant may choose whether or not he wants to participate in the proceedings (Article 376 § 3). However, the choice between personal presence and participation via the video communication system belongs to the court.",0,702
746,746,"The applicant, Mr Mammed Useinovich Settarov, is a Ukrainian national of Tatar origin who was born in 1975 and lives in Simferopol. He was represented before the Court by Mr N. Gurepka, a lawyer practising in the same city. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev, of the Ministry of Justice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 24 April 2002 the applicant was involved in a car accident. According to a report drawn up by the police on the same day, the applicant had been responsible for the accident. On an unspecified date the police transferred the case to the Zaliznodorozhnyy District Court of Simferopol for adjudication. By a resolution of 14 August 2002, the court discontinued the proceedings against the applicant as time-barred. In the same resolution it found that the car accident had been caused by the applicant and that he had committed an offence provided for in Article 124 of the Code on Administrative Offences. The court’s finding was based on the police report, the conclusions of an expert concerning the accident and the victim’s statements. The court did not accept the applicant’s version of the event, though it was confirmed by two witnesses, who had been in the applicant’s car on 24 April 2002. Subsequently, the applicant asked the prosecutors to lodge a protest against the resolution of 14 August 2002. The prosecutors refused. The relevant law is summarised in Rybka v. Ukraine ((dec.), no. 10544/03, 17 November 2009).",0,259
750,750,"4. The applicant was born in 1946 and currently lives in Tbilisi. 5. In the course of a police operation conducted on 15 September 1997 in the village of Becho, Mestia District, the applicant’s house, which happened to be close to the scene, was accidentally burned down together with the adjacent farm buildings. The house had been the applicant’s place of residence prior to the incident. 6. On 15 July 1999 the applicant sued the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Finance for the damage done and, in a judgment of 27 December 2000, the Krtsanisi-Mtatsminda District Court in Tbilisi ordered the respondent authorities to pay him 60,000 Georgian laris (GEL) (26,646 euros (EUR)) in compensation for the destruction of his property (“the judgment debt”). The operative part of the judgment indicated that the payment should be made from the State Budget for 2001. 7. The judgment of 27 December 2000 was upheld in full by the Tbilisi Regional Court and the Supreme Court of Georgia on 21 March and 2 October 2002, respectively, and became binding on the latter date. 8. On 19 November 2002 the Krtsanisi-Mtatsminda District Court issued the respondent authorities with a writ of execution which reiterated the obligation to discharge the judgment debt from the 2001 State Budget. The authorities remained inactive. 9. Subsequent to the applicant’s complaint, on 8 January 2003 the Enforcement Department of the Ministry of Justice (“the Enforcement Department”) invited the respondent authorities to discharge the judgment debt of their own accord within the following three months, on pain of forcible enforcement measures. The allotted time expired without the judgment debt having been paid, but no measures followed. 10. On 11 October 2005 the Enforcement Department issued the National Bank of Georgia with an order to pay the judgment debt. However, as that order indicated the wrong amount, the National Bank sent it back on 25 November 2005 unenforced. 11. On 1 December 2006 the applicant asked the Ministry of Finance for news of progress in the enforcement proceedings. 12. On 13 December 2006 the Ministry of Finance replied that it was unable to discharge the judgment debt, as the Ministry of the Interior had failed to do so of its own accord. 13. In a decision of 19 December 2006, at the applicant’s request, the Tbilisi City Court removed from the judgment of 27 December 2000, as an objectively unenforceable condition, the indication that the debt should be paid from the 2001 State Budget. That decision became binding on 28 May 2007, and on 4 September 2007 the City Court issued a writ for its enforcement. 14. On 2 April 2008, on the basis of the previous enforcement writ of 19 November 2002, the Enforcement Department requested the National Bank of Georgia to disburse the judgment debt. The latter authority did so on 4 April 2008, and three days later the applicant retrieved the debt in full. 15. The relevant legal provisions concerning the conduct of enforcement proceedings against a public agency funded from the State Budget were cited in the case of Amat-G Ltd and Mebaghishvili v. Georgia (no. 2507/03, §§ 25-27, ECHR 2005VIII).",1,527
756,756,"The applicants, Mrs Stina Lise-Lott Sved, Ms Erika Sved, Ms Elin Sved and Mr Markus Sved, are Finnish nationals, who were born in 1957, 1985, 1987 and 1988 respectively and live in Närpiö, Finland. They are the widow and the three children of the late Mr Rune Sved. They are represented before the Court by Mr Matias Wallgren, a lawyer practising in Helsinki, Finland. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows. On 8 November 1995 Mr Rune Sved, who was a farmer, applied for a subsidy to give up greenhouse farming. On 19 January 1996 the Pension Fund for Farming Industry (maatalousyrittäjien eläkelaitos, lantbruksföretagarnas pensionsanstalt) decided to grant Mr Sved a subsidy of FIM 263,800 (approximately 44,400 euros) on condition that the greenhouses were demolished or otherwise permanently taken out of production and the relevant area adjusted to the surrounding landscape. Written information when these measures had been carried out was requested as a condition of payment. Mr Rune Sved died on 21 January 1996 without knowing about the decision. On 6 March 1996 Mr Sved’s widow requested that the subsidy be paid to his estate. On 15 March 1996 the Pension Fund refused to pay the subsidy as the greenhouses had not been demolished before the death of Mr Rune Sved. The applicants appealed to the Pension Board (eläkelautakunta, pensionsnämnden), requesting payment of the subsidy. The Board decided, on 12 February 1997, that the subsidy could not be paid to Mr Sved’s estate since he had not demolished the greenhouses himself during his lifetime. On 27 March 1997, the applicants appealed to the Insurance Court (vakuutusoikeus, försäkringsdomstolen), contending that the Board’s decision was unreasonable as Mr Rune Sved had not been able to demolish the greenhouses as he had not even known about the decision before he died. They noted that they had no other choice than to continue the greenhouse production or to let the greenhouses to another farmer if the court’s decision was not favourable to them. It appears from the statement of appeal that the greenhouses had not been demolished by 27 March 1997. On 2 September 1998 the Insurance Court upheld the Board’s decision. According to Section 4, subsections 1 and 2, of the Act on Subsidy for Reducing Greenhouse Production and Apple Farming (laki kasvihuonetuotannon ja omenanviljelyn lopettamistuesta, lag om stöd för nedläggning av växthusproduktion och äppelodling), a subsidy shall be paid to an applicant on condition that his greenhouses are permanently demolished or otherwise taken out of greenhouse production and the relevant areas adjusted to the landscape. According to Section 3 of the above-mentioned Act, the subsidy can only be granted if the applicant has been farming for a minimum period of ten years immediately before giving up this activity, and on condition that commercial greenhouse farming has been carried out in an area exceeding 500 square metres and the greenhouse farmer has been insured for this activity as a private entrepreneur within the meaning of the Act on Pensions for Private Entrepreneurs (yrittäjien eläkelaki, lag om pension för företagare) or as a farmer within the meaning of the Act on Pensions for Farmers (maatalousyrittäjien eläkelaki, lag om pension för lantbruksföretagare). According to Section 10 of the above-mentioned Act, the subsidy is paid after the greenhouse production or apple farming has ceased.",0,557

In a real estate dispute, on 23 June 1994 Mr S. and others brought an action for a servitude (szolgalom) against the applicants. 6. After three hearings, the preparation of an expert opinion and the identification of a plaintiff's successor, on 18 June 1998 the Salgótarján District Court found for the plaintiffs. On appeal, on 12 November 1998 the Nógrád County Regional Court quashed this decision. 7. In the resumed proceedings, on 4 March 1999 the plaintiffs changed their action and claimed ownership. Subsequently, the proceedings were suspended pending the outcome of an underlying land register procedure. The latter ended on 8 January 2001. On 23 April 2001 the plaintiffs' representative requested the resumption of the principal case. 8. The proceedings resumed on 6 June 2001. After several hearings and the opinion of an expert, on 2 December 2003 the District Court dismissed the action. 9. On appeal, on 11 May 2004 the Regional Court changed this decision and granted the plaintiffs the servitude they sought. 10. On 20 September 2004 the applicants requested the re-opening of the case. On 27 April 2005 the Regional Court admitted their request. 11. In the reopened proceedings, on 8 December 2005 the District Court established that the plaintiffs' adverse possession of the servitude in question had not taken place. It ordered the servitude to be deleted from the land register. 12. On appeal, on 25 April 2006 the Regional Court changed this decision and upheld its decision of 11 May 2004.",1,269
762,762,"4. The applicants were born in 1957 and 1958 respectively and live in Miskolc. 5. On 10 December 1992 a company, E. Ltd., laid charges of fraudulent bankruptcy and other offences against the applicants, then a married couple. Subsequently, the Borsod County Police Department instituted criminal proceedings against the first applicant. On 17 November 1993 he was questioned as a suspect. 6. On 27 December 1993 the Borsod County Police Department prohibited the alienation of the applicants’ real property and their cars. On 22 February 1994 the Miskolc Public Prosecutor’s Office upheld this measure, observing that it was justified because it pursued the aim of guaranteeing the satisfaction of claims brought by the potential civil parties. 7. Meanwhile, on 6 January 1994 the proceedings were extended to include the second applicant as a defendant. 8. On 17 January 1994 the Passport Office of the Ministry of the Interior withdrew the first applicant’s passport until the termination of the criminal proceedings, under sections 2 and 13 of the Foreign Travel Act (Law no. 28 of 1989), in order to secure his availability for trial. That decision was confirmed by the Minister of the Interior on 25 March 1994. 9. On 26 October 1994 the Miskolc Public Prosecutor’s Office preferred a bill of indictment against the applicants, charging them with fraudulent bankruptcy and other offences. 10. Meanwhile, the first applicant requested the Budapest Regional Court to review the administrative decision ordering the withdrawal of his passport. On 9 May 1995 the Regional Court upheld that decision, which in its view had been delivered in accordance with the law. 11. After sixteen hearings between 7 May 1996 and 4 February 2002, on 11 February 2002 the Miskolc District Court convicted the applicants and sentenced them to one year and eight months’ imprisonment and one year and six months’ imprisonment respectively, these sentences being suspended for three years. The court relied on the testimonies of witnesses, extensive documentary evidence and the opinion of three experts. In its reasoning, it appreciated, as a mitigating factor, the “very long time” which had elapsed since the commission of the offences, finding that this delay could not be imputed to the applicants. 12. On appeal, on 11 June 2002, the Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Regional Court quashed the District Court’s judgment on account of a serious procedural shortcoming and remitted the case to the first-instance court. 13. In reply to a request by the applicants to have the case file photocopied, on 17 June 2002 the Regional Court invited them to specify which particular elements they wished to have copied. The court pointed out that the photocopying of the whole case file, which contained several thousand pages (and was in any event available for personal consultation in its entirety), was impossible and also unnecessary, given that many documents were of little relevance. 14. In the resumed proceedings, eighteen hearings were held between 21 October 2002 and 19 May 2005. 15. On 23 May 2005 the District Court convicted the applicants of the offences of breaching accountancy rules (punishable by up to two years’ imprisonment under Article 289 of the Criminal Code) and of fraudulent bankruptcy (punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment under Article 290 of the Criminal Code), and fined them each 270,000 Hungarian forints. 16. On 23 June 2005 the Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Regional Court dismissed an appeal by the applicants. It ordered that the measures attaching the applicants’ assets be discontinued. 17. On 5 January 2006 the Supreme Court’s review bench quashed the second-instance judgment and remitted the case to the Regional Court. 18. In the resumed second-instance proceedings, on 8 June 2006 the Regional Court upheld in essence the applicants’ convictions and fines. It dismissed the civil party’s claims and lifted the prohibition on the alienation of the applicants’ assets. In its reasoning, it reiterated: “[I]n the process of imposing ‘legal detriments’ [joghátrány], the courts fully recognised the extraordinarily protracted nature of the proceedings as an important mitigating factor, and appreciated this circumstance when determining the punishments.” 19. In reply to a complaint in the applicants’ appeal concerning the non-attendance of the experts at the court hearings, the court observed that their opinions had been added to the case file, since they had been extensively presented at the hearing on 10 February 2005. Despite an invitation by the court to do so, the applicants did not comment in writing on those opinions in the ensuing proceedings. Given that the opinions had at all times been available to the defence, copies had been dispatched to the parties, and the opinions had been explained at a hearing, the court was satisfied that the principle of “direct and oral proceedings” had not been infringed. In any event, it was convinced that, given the complexity of the case and the extensiveness of the opinions (amounting to several volumes), any meritorious criticism thereof would only have been possible in writing and the experts – whose views were otherwise essentially convergent – could likewise have reacted to such criticism in writing. The judgment became final on the same day.",0,846

On 12 November 1997 the applicant company instituted civil proceedings against a certain Z. K. for payment. 6. In 1999 and 2000 six hearings were adjourned due to the applicant company’s absence. Furthermore the hearings scheduled for 10 May and 20 September 2005, 10 October 2006, 20 March 2007, 26 March and 22 April 2008 were adjourned or cancelled on the applicant company’s request. 7. On 24 July 2008 the Ostrów Wielkopolski District Court gave a judgment. Both the applicant company and the other party to the proceedings appealed against the judgment. 8. By a judgment of 11 February 2010 the Kalisz Regional Court dismissed the appeals, upholding the first-instance judgment. 9. On an unspecified date the applicant company lodged a complaint under the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki – “the 2004 Act”). It sought a finding that the length of the proceedings had been excessive and claimed 10,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) in compensation. 10. By a decision of 6 January 2005 the Kalisz Regional Court held that the length of the proceedings had been excessive and awarded the applicant company PLN 2,000 in compensation. 11. On 15 April 2009 the applicant company lodged another complaint under the 2004 Act. 12. By a decision of 26 May 2009 the Kalisz Regional Court dismissed the complaint, holding that the proceedings had been conducted in a correct and timely manner. The court further expressed a view that the length of the proceedings had been largely due to the conduct of the parties, including that of the applicant company. 13. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court’s decisions in cases of Charzyński v. Poland (dec.), no. 15212/03, §§ 12-23, ECHR 2005-V; Ratajczyk v. Poland (dec.), no. 11215/02, ECHR 2005-VIII; and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, §§ 34-46, ECHR 2005-V.",1,376

On 22 October 2004 criminal complaints were brought against him by the Athens First Instance Prosecutor for procuring and repeated rape. 6. In 2006, on an unspecified date, the Indictment Division of the Athens Court of Appeal decided to prosecute the applicant and remitted the case to the Athens First Instance Criminal Court (decision no. 303/2006). 7. On 19 July 2006 the Athens First Instance Criminal Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to ten years' imprisonment (judgment no. 2439/2006). 8. On 21 July 2006 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Athens Criminal Court of Appeal challenging the First Instance court's findings and its evaluation of the evidence. 9. By judgment dated 4 May 2009 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's allegations (judgment no. 1245/2009). 10. On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Court of Cassation. The appeal was set for hearing on 3 February 2010. It transpires from the case file that these proceedings are still pending.",1,183
776,776,"4. The applicants were born in 1931 and 1930 and live in Ankara and Hatay, respectively. 5. In 1965 the applicants bought a plot of land in Hatay from the Samandağ Municipality. 6. On 9 September 1976 the Ministry of Construction and Settlement conducted land consolidation proceedings and defined the coastline in the area where the applicants’ land was located. 7. On 27 April 1995 the Samandağ Municipality, acting on behalf of the Treasury, requested the Samandağ Court of First Instance in Civil Matters to determine whether the applicants’ plot of land was located within the coastline area. They claimed that, according to the Coastal Law, the land in question could not be owned by individuals and must only be used for public benefit purposes. 8. On 3 May 1995 a group of experts, composed of a geomorphologist, a cartography engineer and an agricultural engineer, appointed by the court, inspected the applicants’ land and concluded that it was located within the coastline area. 9. On 3 July 1995 the Samandağ Municipality filed an action before the Samandağ Court of First Instance in Civil Matters, on behalf of the Treasury, requesting the annulment of the record in the title deed registry of the applicants’ ownership. Furthermore, it requested the court to issue an injunction in order to prevent any transfer of that title until the end of the case. 10. On 19 September 1996 the applicants filed a petition with the court objecting to the expert report of 3 May 1995. They argued that, as the expert report failed to take into consideration the flora of their property as well as the features and age of the surrounding buildings, it could not be taken as a basis for the annulment of the record in the title deed register. Moreover, they maintained that the Municipality had not only disposed of the property as the original owner, but it had also encouraged the construction of buildings in the surrounding area, by implementing a development plan. 11. The court decided to obtain the opinion of another group of experts. On 28 October 1997, following a second inspection, the experts confirmed the first report. The summary of the report is as follows: “The first cadastral survey was carried out in the area on 29 March 1948. Thus, the title deed of the plot of land was registered before the coastal law came into force. The plot of land in question is covered by the development plan, approved by the Ministry of Public Works and Settlement. However, at the present time there is no construction on this plot. The inspection carried out in the surrounding area reveals that the land is situated on the beach which is considered as the prolongation of the sea. The soil has a sandy texture. There is no vegetation on the land, as the soil is not suitable for cultivation. The land is located within the coastline. Thus the plot of land in question has to be under the authority of the State. It cannot be the subject of private property.” 12. On 16 December 1999 the Samandağ First Instance Court upheld the request of the Treasury and decided to annul the record in the title deed register. It also ordered the applicants to reimburse the legal expenses of the plaintiff. The summary of the court’s reasoning in its final decision is as follows: “At the time when the coastline had been determined, Law no. 6785 on urbanism (9 July 1956) was in force. The definition of the coastline found in Article 105 of Law no. 6785 is similar to the description in the Coastal Law (Law no. 3621). Article 43 of the Constitution provides that the coasts are under the authority of the State. This assertion is also established by Article 641 of the Civil Code, Article 33 of the Land Registry Law and Article 16 of the Cadastral Law. Thus, coasts cannot be subject to private property rights. As it is stated by the Constitutional Court in its decisions dated 25 February 1986 and 18 September 1991, the construction of buildings on these lands and the use of these buildings in good faith cannot provide a derogation from this rule. In the light of the above, the court decides to annul the record in the title deed registry, which was in the name of the applicants. Furthermore it decides to prolong the interim measure, until the court’s decision becomes final.” 13. The applicants appealed against this decision, arguing that they had a vested interest on this property that had to be respected by the authorities. Furthermore, they maintained that, according to the cadastral survey which was carried out in 1938, the plot of land was designated as an unrestricted, public area. Since the cadastral planning of a location can only be carried out once, there cannot be any dispute concerning their property rights over the plot of land in question. Additionally, they claimed that the experts had erred in their establishment of the coastline. 14. On 3 October 2000, in view of the expert reports as well as the established case-law on this matter, the Court of Cassation upheld the decision of the Samandağ Court of First Instance. 15. On 30 April 2001 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants’ request for rectification of the decision as none of the conditions required by Article 440 of the Code on Civil Procedure were present in the case. The applicants were notified of the decision on 5 June 2001. 16. Article 43 of the Constitution provides: “The coasts are under the control and at the disposal of the State. Public interest has priority with regard to the exploitation of the sea coasts, lake shores or river banks and the coastal strip along the sea and lakes. Taking into consideration the purpose of their use, the width of coasts and coastal strips and the conditions in which individuals can make use of these locations shall be determined by law.”",0,997
779,779,"4. The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in the town of Cherkessk of the Karachayevo-Cherkessiya Republic. 5. According to the applicant, on 13 July 1997 the police instituted administrative proceedings against him for having disobeyed a lawful order of a police officer and arrested him. On the following day the Elista Town Court of the Kalmykiya Republic discontinued the proceedings because there was no indication of an administrative offence. The decision of the Town Court did not contain any reference to the applicant's alleged deprivation of liberty. 6. The applicant submitted that after the hearing the policemen brought him back to a police station. They handcuffed him to a heating device, put a plastic bag on his head and severely beat him up. 7. On 16 July 1997 an investigator of the Department of Internal Affairs of the Karachayevo-Cherkessiya Republic instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant and three other persons on suspicion of participation in a criminal enterprise and ordered their arrest. As it follows from a record of 16 July 1997, the applicant was arrested on the same day at 11.50 p.m. He was also charged with unlawful possession of a weapon. 8. On 30 December 1998 the Cherkessk Town Court acquitted the applicant and ordered his immediate release. The judgment became final on 2 February 1999 when it was upheld by the Supreme Court of the Karachayevo-Cherkessiya Republic. 9. In August 2000 the applicant lodged an action against the Treasury and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation for compensation for non-pecuniary damage incurred through unlawful detention. 10. On 11 March 2001 the Cherkessk Town Court accepted the applicant's action and ordered that the Ministry of Internal Affairs should pay the applicant 190,000 Russian roubles (RUR, 7,095 euros) at the expense of the Treasury. The Town Court held as follows: “Mr Volkov was unlawfully detained from 16 July 1997 to 30 December 1998, that is for a total of 535 days. It was proven at the court hearing that Mr Volkov sustained non-pecuniary damage and it should be compensated because he was acquitted by a final judgment. According to paragraph 8 of the Decree of the Plenary Supreme Court of the Russian Federation no. 10 of 20 December 1994 'On certain questions concerning application of the domestic law on compensation for non-pecuniary damage'... the amount of compensation depends on the character and extent of moral and physical suffering caused to the plaintiff, fault of the defendant in each particular case, and other circumstances which merit attention... The court ... takes into account that the amount and extent of moral and physical suffering of a person depend on his subjective perception of the existing situation and considers that, having regard to the arguments and evidence submitted by the parties, it is possible to award the plaintiff 190,000 roubles in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. Assessing the moral sufferings caused to the plaintiff, possible consequences of the plaintiff's conviction, and having examined the materials of the criminal case-file, the court considers that the awarded amount is reasonable and fair.” The judgment of 11 March 2001 was not appealed against and became final. 11. On an unspecified date the President of the Supreme Court of the Karachayevo-Cherkessiya Republic lodged before the Presidium of the Supreme Court an application for a supervisory review of the judgment of 11 March 2001 because the Town Court should have issued the judgment directly against the Treasury and should have excluded the Ministry of Internal Affairs from the proceedings. 12. On 8 August 2001 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Karachaevo-Cherkessiya Republic, by way of supervisory-review proceedings, quashed the judgment of 11 March 2001 and remitted the case for a fresh examination. The Presidium noted that the Town Court had incorrectly assessed the amount of compensation and that it should have joined the Treasury as defendant to the proceedings. 13. On 27 September 2001 the Cherkessk Town Court found that the applicant's detention had been unlawful but reduced compensation to RUR 5,000 (EUR 184). The reasoning in the judgment of 27 September 2001 repeated word by word that of the judgment of 11 March 2001, save for the amount in the penultimate paragraph where 190,000 was replaced with 5,000. The judgment of 27 September 2001 was upheld on appeal on 16 October 2001.",1,722
782,782,"7. Mr Francesco Lombardo resides in Rome. The facts established by the Commission pursuant to Article 31 para. 1 (art. 32-1) of the Convention are as follows (see paragraphs 15-30 of its report): 15. The applicant served in the Carabinieri from 15 August 1946 to 14 March 1974, on which date he was invalided out of the service because he had become disabled as a result of two illnesses - an ulcer and neoplasia. 16. Since 29 January 1975 the applicant has been in receipt of an ordinary retirement pension. 17. On 10 June 1974 he applied for an ‘enhanced ordinary pension’ on the ground that the illnesses which had caused his disablement were ‘due to his service’. On 19 October 1976 the applicant was examined at the Messina military hospital by the Ministry of Defence medico-legal board. On 26 November 1976 the board concluded that the neoplasia which had caused the applicant’s disablement was not ‘due to his service’. 18. On 21 May 1977, in its decision on the applicant’s request, the Ministry of Defence granted him payment at the enhanced rate for two years, on the ground that the ulcer he suffered from was ‘due to his service’, but rejected that part of his application concerning the neoplasia. 19. In a registered letter dated 20 December 1977 the applicant appealed to the Court of Audit against this decision. The appeal was received by the Court of Audit on 22 December 1977 and reached the competent division of that court on 3 January 1978, being registered under file no. 0110931. 20. On 7 September 1978 the applicant asked for his appeal to be given priority, by derogation from the chronological order principle usually applied. Following this request, on 13 September 1978, the registry of the Court of Audit asked the Ministry of Defence for the applicant’s administrative file; on 23 September 1978 it again asked for this file to be forwarded. 21. In a note of 20 October 1978 the Ministry of Defence announced that it was shortly to adopt an administrative measure concerning the applicant [- an adjustment of his pension -] and that the file would be transmitted thereafter. 22. The file was received by the registry of the Court of Audit on 4 December 1980. On 13 January 1981 the applicant’s appeal and his file were transmitted to the principal public prosecutor, who [granting Mr Lombardo’s application of 23 February 1982] on 8 January 1983 decided to give the case priority. 23. On 17 September 1985 the principal public prosecutor requested the opinion of the Ministry of Defence medico-legal board. He received this opinion on 7 April 1986. It confirmed that the applicant’s neoplasia was not ‘due to his service’. 24. On the basis of this opinion, on 6 June 1987, the principal public prosecutor submitted his pleadings, calling for the appeal to be dismissed. 25. On 28 October 1987 the applicant again asked for his case to be given priority. 26. On 30 November 1987 the president of the division of the Court of Audit dealing with the case arranged for a hearing to be held before that division on 27 April 1988. However, the hearing did not take place because, following a judgment of the Constitutional Court (no. 270 of 25 February 1988), the Judicial Division of the Palermo Court of Audit gained jurisdiction to hear the case, which was transferred to it on 25 May 1988. 27. This division heard the case at a hearing held on 15 February 1989, at the end of which it upheld the applicant’s appeal. The text of the judgment was deposited with the registry on 7 July 1989. ... B. The relevant domestic law 28. In pursuance of the provisions of Presidential Decree no. 1092 of 29 December 1973, state public servants are entitled to an ‘enhanced ordinary pension’ when their employment in the public service is terminated as a result of a disability or injury attributable to the requirements of the service. 29. Public servants make direct contributions to the pension fund through monthly payments calculated as a fixed percentage of their wages and deducted therefrom. 30. The nature of the disability or injury is taken into account for the purpose of deciding which scale is to be applied in calculating the amount of pension. For professional members of the armed forces these scales range from 30% to 100% of the figure used as the basis for the calculation of pension, i.e. the full amount of the latest remuneration received, plus certain allowances where appropriate. Consequently, the amount of the pension granted is not directly linked to the total contributions paid into the pension fund by the person concerned."" 8. On 26 November 1991 the applicant informed the Court that Italy had now paid him part of the amount in issue.",1,805
785,785,"1. The applicant, Ms Zybeyde Sahin, is an Austrian national who was born in 1974 and lives in Innsbruck. She is represented before the Court by Mr L. Szabo, a lawyer practising in Innsbruck. The Austrian Government (“the Government”) are represented by their Agent, Ambassador H. Tichy, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs. 2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 3. The applicant and her husband had two children: a daughter D, born in 1997, and a son S, born in 1999. Following allegations against the applicant’s husband of violence against the children and sexual abuse of D, the Innsbruck Youth Welfare Office (Jugendwohlfahrtsträger) removed both children from their home and placed them in a children’s home as a provisional measure on 20 December 2005, having found the children to be in imminent danger as required by Article 215 § 1 of the Civil Code. 4. In compliance with the time-limit set out in Article 215 § 1 of the Civil Code, the Youth Welfare Office thereafter, on 27 December 2005, applied to the Innsbruck District Court (Bezirksgericht Innsbruck) seeking to be awarded custody of the children for the purposes of their care and education and to have their placement in a children’s home approved. 5. The applicant and her husband denied the allegations of domestic violence or sexual abuse and requested the court to dismiss the authority’s application for custody. 6. The District Court promptly heard the applicant and her husband, the children’s teachers, other witnesses and commissioned an expert opinion. Following its investigation, on 24 February 2006 the Innsbruck District Court dismissed the Youth Welfare Office’s custody application, but ordered the parents to attend weekly psychotherapy sessions offered by a specialised association and to allow the children to receive psychological counselling if recommended by the association. 7. The children were returned to their parents on 3 March 2006. 8. The Youth Welfare Office appealed against the District Court’s decision, but on 5 May 2006 the Innsbruck Regional Court (Landesgericht Innsbruck) dismissed the appeal. 9. In addition to the above civil proceedings, the applicant applied on 29 January 2006 to the Tyrol Independent Administrative Panel (Unabhängiger Verwaltungssenat Tirol) and contested the measures taken by the Youth Welfare Office. She requested it to rule that the Youth Welfare Office had violated her rights by removing the children on 20 December 2005, complaining that the children had been taken away without the applicant having first given evidence, and arguing that until the court had issued a decision their placement in a children’s home had been without any legal basis. She also argued that the provisional removal of the children from their home on the basis of suspicions of domestic violence had been disproportionate. 10. On 29 March 2006 the Independent Administrative Panel rejected the application. It found that the measures were based on the provisions of the Civil Code and not on the administrative law. Thus, only the civil courts were competent to decide on the lawfulness of the measure. 11. The applicant lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court against that decision under Article 144 of the Federal Constitution. 12. On 20 June 2007 the Constitutional Court dismissed the complaint confirming its case-law whereby a provisional measure implemented by the Youth Welfare Office pursuant to Article 215 § 1 of the Civil Code was a measure under civil law. Accordingly, the administrative authorities had no jurisdiction to decide on the applicant’s application. 13. The Constitutional Court’s judgment was served on the applicant’s counsel on 12 July 2007. 14. Under Article 215 § 1 of the Civil Code (Allgemeines Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch), the competent Youth Welfare Office must apply for court orders regarding custody measures which are necessary in order to ensure a child’s well-being. Where a child is in imminent danger, the Youth Welfare Office must also make the necessary provisional arrangements concerning care and custody until the competent court has given a decision. Such provisional arrangements have to be notified to the competent District Court immediately, at the latest within eight days. 15. Article 138 of the Federal Constitution (Bundesverfassungsgesetz) provides that the Constitutional Court decides on conflicts of jurisdiction between the courts and the administrative authorities. Under Article 144 of the Federal Constitution, an application can be lodged with the Constitutional Court alleging a violation of a constitutional right as the result of a decision of the administrative authorities, including the Independent Administrative Panels. 16. Pursuant to section 1 of the Official Liability Act (Amtshaftungsgesetz), the Federation, the Länder, districts, municipalities, other bodies of public law and the institutions of social insurance (hereinafter named “legal entities”; Rechtsträger) are liable pursuant to the relevant civil law for any damages caused deliberately or negligently by unlawful acts carried out by their officials in the execution and enforcement of the law. Sections 8 and 9 of the Official Liability Act provide that, as a first step, an injured party shall demand a written statement of the legal entity, against which a claim of damages is to be raised, indicating whether the legal entity at issue accepts or rejects the claim for damages. Such a statement shall be rendered within three months. After expiration of the delay of three months and in the event the legal entity does not accept the claim (in full), the injured party can lodge an action for damages with the competent Regional Civil Court.",0,914
786,786,"The applicant, Mr Franz Fischer, is an Austrian national, who was born in 1974 and lives in Wilhelmsburg. He was represented before the Court by Mr S. Gloss, a lawyer practising in St. Pölten. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. On 29 May 2001 the European Court of Human Rights delivered a judgment in a case which had been introduced by the applicant (Franz Fischer v. Austria, no. 37950/97, unreported). It found a violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 in that the applicant had consecutively been tried and punished for two offences containing the same essential elements, first by the administrative authority for the offence of drunken driving under section 5 (1) and 99 (1) (a) of the Road Traffic Act and, after that decision had become final, by the Criminal Court for causing death by negligence with the special element under Article 81 § 2 of the Criminal Code of “allowing himself to become intoxicated”, whereby intoxication is irrebuttably presumed where a person’s blood alcohol level is above 0.8 grams per litre. On 30 May 2001 the applicant filed an application with the Supreme Court under Article 363a of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see below), requesting a retrial. On 30 October 2001 the applicant requested the Supreme Court to hold a hearing. On 22 November 2001 the Supreme Court dismissed the application without holding a hearing. The Supreme Court found that the requirements of Article 363a of the Code of Criminal Procedure were not met, as the Franz Fischer v. Austria judgment had not established that there had been a violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 “on account of a decision of a criminal court”. In reaching this conclusion the Supreme Court had regard to the Court’s reasoning whereby the question whether or not the non bis in idem principle was violated concerned the relationship between the two offences at issue but not the order in which the two sets of proceedings were conducted, and that the Contracting State remained free to determine which of the two offences was to be prosecuted. The Supreme Court’s decision was served on 17 January 2002. Under the heading “retrial” (Erneuerung des Strafverfahrens) the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozeßordnung) provides as follows: “1. If it is established in a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights that there has been a violation of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (Bundesgesetzblatt [Official Gazette] no. 210/1958) or of one of its Protocols on account of a decision or order of a criminal court, a retrial shall be held on application in so far as it cannot be ruled out that the violation might have affected the content of a criminal court’s decision in a manner detrimental to the person concerned. 2. All applications for a retrial shall be decided by the Supreme Court. ...” “1. On an application for a retrial, the Supreme Court shall deliberate in private only where the Procurator General or the judge rapporteur proposes that a decision be taken on one of the grounds set out in paragraphs 2 and 3. 2. Where the Supreme Court deliberates in private, it may refuse an application ... if it unanimously considers the application to be manifestly ill-founded. ...”",0,555
791,791,"The applicant, John Bland, is a United Kingdom national, who was born on 12 April 1940 and lives in Cowling, North Yorkshire. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant applied to the Benefits Agency for a retirement pension, but was informed, by a letter dated 17 May 2000, that the Agency would not consider his claim until four months before his sixty-fifth birthday. At present, women in the United Kingdom become eligible for a State pension at the age of sixty, whereas men are not eligible until sixty five. In their Observations, the Government submitted that the applicant received a total of GBP 236.15 per week in State benefits, including income support, disability living allowance and invalid care allowance. They claimed that the applicant would be in an identical financial position if he were a woman, the only difference being that part of the money paid to him by the State would be paid in the form of retirement pension rather than income support. The applicant has not denied the Government’s account of his income. He claims, however, that if he were in receipt of State pension he would in addition be entitled to other financial benefits, such as a bus pass and discounts in shops, restaurants and hairdressers.",0,219
792,792,"5. In 1951 the State authorities took more than three hectares of land from a relative of the applicants. No compensation was paid to the owner. 6. The applicants unsuccessfully claimed restitution of the land under Law no. 503/2003. In particular, in a judgment of 13 December 2006 the Supreme Court held, in a review of the decisions made at lower levels of jurisdiction, that the land had been formally transferred to the State pursuant to Ordinance 15/1959. Section 3 of Law no. 503/2003 did not include such a situation as grounds for restitution of property. The applicants could have claimed restitution of the land earlier, under Law no. 403/1990, but they had not done so. 7. On 23 April 2007 the applicants lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court. They alleged a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, and also of their constitutional right to own property. 8. In particular, the applicants argued that the land had been expropriated without compensation. It was therefore liable to restitution under section 3(1)(m) and (n) of Law no. 503/2003, irrespective of the fact that that law contained no reference to Ordinance 15/1959. They referred to the Supreme Court’s judgment 3SžoKS 130/2005 of 9 June 2006, which found that a situation similar to that of the applicants fell under Law no. 503/2003. 9. On 25 October 2007 the Constitutional Court dismissed the complaint (decision III. ÚS 287/07). It held that the Supreme Court had given sufficient reasons for its judgment, which was neither arbitrary nor otherwise contrary to the constitutional principles. It was not for the Constitutional Court to review the way in which ordinary courts interpreted and applied the law unless it resulted in a breach of the Constitution. 10. The decision was served on 18 December 2007. 11. Law no 503/2003 governs restitution of agricultural land and forests. 12. Cases in which land is to be restored to owners or their successors are listed in section 3. In particular, sub-section 1(m) of section 3 refers to situations where land has been expropriated without compensation. Subsection 1(n) refers to nationalisation contrary to the legal rules then in force or without compensation. 13. In its judgment 3SžoKS 130/2005 of 9 June 2006 the Supreme Court held that transfer of property under Ordinance 15/1959 without compensation was to be qualified as a reason for restitution of such property under section 3(1)(m) of Law no. 503/2003. Any other interpretation of that provision would run contrary to the Constitution. 14. The same conclusion was reached in judgment 6 Sžo 240/2008 of 14 October 2009 as rectified by the decision under the same file number of 27 November 2009. 15. In an unspecified number of other decisions the Supreme Court expressed a different view on the matter, namely the same as expressed in the above judgment on the applicant’s case of 13 December 2006. 16. In judgment IV. ÚS 209/2010 of 16 September 2010 the Constitutional Court found, with reference to the Supreme Court judgments 3SžoKS 130/2005 of 9 June 2006 and 6 Sžo 240/2008 of 14 October 2009 (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above), that the varying practice on the part of the Supreme Court when determining whether expropriation of land under Ordinance 15/1959 fell under Law no. 503/2003 ran contrary to the principle of legal certainty. That in itself justified the conclusion that the plaintiff’s constitutional rights had been breached. 17. In the same judgment the Constitutional Court further found that the Supreme Court’s view, that land expropriated under Ordinance 15/1959 could not be restored under Law no. 503/2003, was formalistic and contrary to the purpose of that Law. The explanatory report to Law no. 503/2003 specified that it extended to individuals who could have, but had not, submitted their claim within time-limits set in different pieces of legislation which had been enacted previously. 18. The Constitutional Court quashed the Supreme Court’s judgment in issue and returned the case to the latter. 19. Subsequently, similar views and conclusions were reached in other judgments of the Constitutional Court (III. ÚS 212/2010, III. ÚS 185/2010 or I. ÚS 407/2010).",1,685

On 11 November 1996 the applicant, a farmer who reared cows, concluded an insurance agreement (полиса за осигурување) (“the agreement”) with an insurance company (“the defendant”) against a risk of the cows' death under which the latter would be liable to pay the damage, irrespective of the time of the death, if it was caused by reasons other than illness. On 23 November 1996 one of the applicant's cows died. Since the defendant refused to pay for the loss, on 30 January 1997 the applicant brought a claim against the defendant before the Štip Court of First Instance (“the first-instance court”). 7. On 1 March 1997 the trial judge's wife was employed with the defendant as an assistant to the manager of its branch office. 8. On 30 January 1998 the first-instance court dismissed the applicant's claim. 9. The applicant appealed, arguing, amongst other things, that the first-instance court had arbitrarily given weight to evidence in favour of the defendant and that it had refused to examine witnesses as to the cause of death. 10. On 17 June 1998 the Štip Court of Appeal quashed the court of first instance's decision, instructing it to hear evidence from the vet who had examined the cow in order to determine the cause of the death. 11. On 28 March 2000 the first-instance court dismissed the applicant's claim, reiterating its earlier findings. 12. On 20 June 2000 the applicant appealed, arguing that he had never received a copy of the general terms of the contract, and that the cause of death had not been properly established. He also contended that that judge was biased since his wife had started working with the defendant just after the proceedings had started. He asked for the trial judge to be removed if the Court of Appeal were to quash the lower court's decision and remit the case 13. On 27 November 2000 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal, finding no grounds to depart from the established facts and the reasons given by the lower court. It did not make any comments on the applicant's allegations that the trial judge was biased. 14. The decision was served on the applicant on 24 April 2001. 15. The relevant provisions of the then Civil Proceedings Act (Закон за парничната постапка) provided as follows: “A judge or a lay-judge cannot perform his/ her judicial function if: he/ she is a party, a statutory representative or a counsel of a party...; he/ she is permanently or temporary employed by a party to the proceedings; the party or its counsel is his/ her relative...; he/ she is a custodian, an adoptive parent, an adoptive child ...of a party; he/ she participated in the rendering of any decision by a lower court or another body; and there are other grounds which cast doubts to his/her impartiality.” Section 66 § 2 “A judge who considers that there are other grounds which put his/her impartiality under doubt should give notice to the President of the court who will decide on his/her exclusion.” Section 67 §§ 1, 2, 4 “The parties may also challenge the participation of a judge. The party concerned is obliged to challenge (изземање) a trial judge or a lay-judge as soon as it learns about it, but not later than the end of the trial before the first-instance court i.e. until the adoption of the decision. The party concerned is obliged to provide the reasons for challenging a judge's ability to sit in a case.”",1,597

They were registered disabled and became entitled to various social benefits, including food allowance. 5. On unspecified dates they sued the competent authorities for adjustment of the monthly food allowance in line with the inflation rate. 6. By two separate judgments of 4 June 2007, one in favour of Mr Pavlenko and another in favour of the remaining applicants, the Mineralniye Vody Town Court of the Stavropol Region upheld their actions in part. The court ordered the local department of the State Treasury to pay 1,283.86 RUB Russian roubles (RUB) to Mr Pavlenko and RUB 1,925.45 to each of the remaining applicants in monthly disability pension payments, to be adjusted in accordance with legal requirements. The court further ordered the local welfare authority to provide monthly the Treasury with the documents necessary to make the payments. It also awarded RUB 67,616.22 to Mr Pavlenko and RUB 104,405.82 to each of the seven other applicants in respect of the outstanding benefits, to be paid by the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation. 7. The judgments were not appealed against and became final on 19 June 2007. 8. The enforcement proceedings were opened and the lump sums and the monthly payments were made in accordance with these judgments. Thus, as from July 2007 all the applicants were receiving the monthly payments in good time. On 24 September 2007 the applicants (except for Mr Pavlenko) received RUB 104,405.82 each. On 1 October 2007 Mr Pavlenko received RUB 67,616.22 due to him under the judgment of 4 June 2007. 9. On 10 October 2007 the Ministry of Finance applied to the Stavropol Regional Court requesting to institute supervisory-review proceedings in respect of the judgments in the applicants' favour. 10. On 29 November 2007 the Presidium of the Stavropol Regional Court, by two separate judgments, quashed the awards of 4 June 2007 and remitted the cases for a fresh examination. The Presidium found that the lower court had erred in applying the provisions of the Law No. 1244-1 “On Social Protection of Citizens Exposed to Radiation as a Result of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station Explosion” (“the Chernobyl Law”) and, as a result, incorrectly determined the defendant authority in the case. The Presidium had not specified a due defendant. 11. In December 2007 the State Treasury discontinued the monthly payments in respect of food allowance due to the applicants under the quashed judgments. Instead, the authorities started to pay the applicants monthly disability benefits in accordance with the relevant legislation. 12. On 15 February 2008 the Town Court discontinued the proceedings in all cases except for that of Mr Pavlenko, due to the applicants' failure to appear before the first instance court. On 19 February 2008 the proceedings in Mr Pavlenko's case were discontinued by the Town Court on the same ground. 13. In February 2009 the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation brought proceedings against all applicants claiming repayment of the lump sums they had received pursuant to the quashed judgments. On 4 March 2009 the Town Court rejected the claim. It appears that the judgment was not appealed against and became final. 14. The relevant domestic law governing the supervisory review procedure at the material time is summed up in the Court's judgment in the case of Kot v. Russia (no. 20887/03, § 17, 18 January 2007).",1,571
801,801,"4. The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in the Voronezh Region. 5. The applicant receives welfare payments for her child. In 1999 she brought civil proceedings against a local welfare authority, claiming arrears in those payments for 1998 – 1999. 6. On 17 December 1999 the Novousmanskiy District Court of the Voronezh Region awarded the applicant 1,593.54 Russian roubles (RUR). 7. On 17 March 2000 a writ of execution was issued and sent to the bailiffs. 8. On 24 October 2001 the bailiffs discontinued the enforcement proceedings in respect of the judgment of 17 December 1999 and returned the writ of execution to the applicant, as the debtor had insufficient funds. 9. In January – February 2004 the applicant was paid the amount due pursuant to the writ of execution. 10. Section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997 provides that a bailiff’s order on the institution of enforcement proceedings must fix a time-limit for the defendant’s voluntary compliance with a writ of execution. The time-limit may not exceed five days. The bailiff must also warn the defendant that coercive action will follow, should the defendant fail to comply with the time-limit. 11. Under Section 13 of the Law, the enforcement proceedings should be completed within two months of the receipt of the writ of enforcement by the bailiff.",1,226
802,802,"4. The applicant was born in 1924 and lives in Piacenza. 5. On 8 April 1974 the applicant sued M.P. in the Piacenza District Court seeking damages for the loss she had sustained as a result of works carried out by her neighbour which had resulted, among other things, in sewage being dumped on her property. 6. Preparation of the case for trial began on 11 May 1974. Of the sixty- six hearings scheduled between 11 November 1974 and 15 June 1995 nineteen were adjourned at the request of the parties, three at the request of the applicant, two at the request of M.P., four by the court of its own motion, and one on account of a lawyers’ strike; twelve were devoted to organising expert evidence, twelve to the filing of documents and the hearing of witnesses, twelve to attempts to seek a friendly settlement, and one was adjourned in order to allow the parties to make their submissions. 7. In the meantime M. P.’s lawyer had filed a death certificate with the registry in respect of his client. At a hearing on 29 February 1996 the judge declared the proceedings interrupted. On 25 September 1996 the parties resumed the proceedings and the judge fixed 11 June 1998 as the date for hearing submissions. On an unspecified date the case was referred to the panel of judges dealing with the oldest cases (Sezioni Stralcio). At a hearing on 18 November 1999 the parties requested that a date be fixed for hearing oral submissions and the judge adjourned the case to 8 June 2000. The hearing was not held on that date, but adjourned to 12 June 2000. On that date the judge allowed the parties to take the files out. 8. In a judgment of 23 October 2000, the text of which was deposited with the registry on the same day, the Piacenza Court allowed the applicant’s claim in part and ordered M. P.’s heir to move the septic tank that had not been installed at the prescribed distance and to replace part of the applicant’s sullage pipes. It also awarded her 15,000,000 Italian lire (7,747 euros). 9. On 17 October 2001 the applicant lodged an application with the Ancona Court of Appeal under Law no. 89 of 24 March 2001, known as the “Pinto” Act, complaining of the excessive length of the above-described proceedings. The applicant requested the court to rule that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and to order the Italian Government to pay compensation for the non-pecuniary damage sustained. The applicant claimed 200,000,000 Italian lire (103,291.37 euros (EUR)) in non-pecuniary damages. 10. In a decision of 31 January 2002, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 13 February 2002, the Court of Appeal found that a reasonable time had been exceeded. It dismissed the claim for pecuniary damages on the ground that the applicant had failed to substantiate it, awarded her EUR 5,000 on an equitable basis in compensation for the non-pecuniary damage and EUR 860 for costs and expenses. The decision was served on the applicant on 13 March 2002. 11. The applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation against that decision on 21 May 2002 on the ground that the amount awarded her by the Court of Appeal was inadequate. 12. However, in a judgment of 12 November 2002, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 3 January 2003, the Court of Cassation declared the appeal inadmissible on the ground that it had been lodged out of time. The authorities paid the amounts due on 23 December 2003. 13. In a letter of 25 August 2003 the applicant informed the Court of the outcome of the domestic proceedings and asked it to resume its examination of her application.",1,638
804,804,"5. The applicants are pensioners who live in the Moscow Region. Before retirement they used to work in hazardous industry. They had a dispute with a pension authority about the scope of their privileged pensions and appealed to the Region’s district and town courts. 6. In March–November 2006 the courts held for the applicants and ordered the pension authority to recalculate the pensions. The courts based their finding on the Law on Labour Pensions. In May 2006–February 2007 these judgments became binding and were executed. 7. On the pension authority’s request, in October 2007–March 2008 the district and town courts quashed their judgments due to discovery of new circumstances. The courts found, in particular, that the judgments had ignored the interpretation of the Law on Labour Pensions given by the Supreme Court in December 2005 and March 2007. 8. The applicants’ cases were remitted for a rehearing and eventually dismissed.",1,150
808,808,"The applicant, Mr Igor Mikhaylovich Ivanov, is a Russian national who was born in 1938 and lives in St. Petersburg. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 30 March 1993 the applicant initiated proceedings before the Kolpinskiy District Court of St. Petersburg against his former employer, a private company, for reinstatement and payment of salary for the period of unemployment. By judgment of 29 April 1997 the Kolpinskiy District Court reinstated the applicant and ordered that the employer should pay him arrears. By final judgment of 7 August 1997 the St. Petersburg City Court increased the amount of arrears to be paid to the applicant and upheld the remainder of the judgment. On 17 December 1997 the Presidium of the St. Petersburg City Court, by way of supervisory review, quashed the judgments of 29 April and 7 August 1997 in the part concerning payment of arrears. This issue was accordingly to be examined anew. The District Court received the case-file in January 1998 and fixed the first hearing for 7 April 1998 during which the applicant amended his claims. The following hearing, listed for 15 July 1998, was adjourned because the parties defaulted and the following hearing was thus scheduled for 10 September 1998, taking into consideration the summer vacation period. In September 1998 the applicant again amended his claims, now also seeking compensation for non-pecuniary damage. On 30 September 1998 the Kolpinskiy District Court, upon the applicant’s request, adjourned the proceedings and ordered an expert opinion. The proceedings were resumed in December 1998. Six hearings were fixed between 1 December 1998 and 5 April 1999. Of those one hearing was adjourned because the respondent defaulted and four hearings were adjourned in order to obtain additional evidence and an expert opinion. During hearings in May and June 1999 the applicant amended his claims. By judgment of 7 June 1999 the Kolpinskiy District Court dismissed the applicant’s claims. The judgment was quashed on appeal on 27 July 1999 and the case concerning the payment of arrears and non-pecuniary damage returned to the District Court for re-examination. The first hearing was fixed for 27 September 1999. The following three hearings listed between 27 September 1999 and 4 February 2000 were adjourned, two of them due to the respondent’s absence and one because the applicant was ill. On 7 February 2000 another presiding judge was assigned to the case. The following hearing, listed for 16 May 2000, was adjourned because the new judge participated in other unrelated proceedings. In June 2000 the District Court, upon the applicant’s request, stayed the proceedings and ordered an additional expert opinion. On 4 October 2000 the expert notified the court that the opinion had not been prepared because the fees for preparing such an opinion had not been paid. The District Court informed the applicant that he should bear the expenses of the expert work. In December 2000 the expert returned the case-file to the court as the applicant had not paid the fees. In January 2001 the applicant successfully asked the District Court to resume the proceedings. A hearing was fixed for 2 March 2001. By judgment of 23 March 2001 the Kolpinskiy District Court dismissed the applicant’s claims once again. On 31 May 2001 the St. Petersburg City Court quashed that judgment in the part concerning the compensation for non-pecuniary damage, remitted this matter for a fresh examination and upheld the remainder of the judgment. In June 2001 the case-file was returned to the District Court and a new presiding judge was assigned to the case. A hearing was fixed for 14 August 2001, however, it was adjourned due to the respondent’s absence. The hearing was thereafter scheduled for 2 November 2001. By judgment of 2 November 2001 the Kolpinskiy District Court of St. Petersburg awarded the applicant 500 Russian roubles as compensation for non-pecuniary damage. That judgment was upheld on appeal on 29 January 2002.",0,684
813,813,"1. The applicant, Mr Kalevi Ensio Nieminen, is a Finnish national who was born in 1952 and lives in Nokia. He was represented before the Court by Mr Jaakko Tuutti, a lawyer practising in Tampere. 2. The Finnish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Arto Kosonen of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. On 21 July 2009, in his own apartment, the applicant stabbed another person with a knife. The victim called the police. When the police patrol arrived, they found a person with a deep, bleeding wound in front of the applicant’s home who told them that he had been stabbed in the applicant’s home by the applicant. As it was not known whether other persons were in danger, the police officers entered the applicant’s home in order to prevent any possible further act or event which might seriously threaten another person’s life, personal liberty or health. In the apartment they found nobody but the applicant. He was severely intoxicated, a breathalyser showed a result of 4.00 per mill, and he was not able to give a statement. He was taken to the local police station. The police officers found and seized a knife with a 17 cm blade covered in blood. 5. On 22 July 2009 the applicant was questioned on suspicion of aggravated assault (törkeä pahoinpitely, grov misshandel). He was released on the same day. 6. On 1 October 2009 the applicant was charged with aggravated assault. 7. On 26 November 2009 the Tampere District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten) dismissed all charges against the applicant. It found that the applicant had not intentionally hurt the other person and that the latter’s injury could have been caused accidentally as both the applicant and the victim had been severely intoxicated. No motive for the act could be established. The applicant and the victim were still good friends and had even come to the oral hearing together. 8. No appeal was made against this judgment and it thus became final. 9. According to Article 10 of the Finnish Constitution (perustuslaki, grundlagen, Act no. 731/1999), the sanctity of everyone’s home is guaranteed. Measures derogating from this right, and which are necessary for the purpose of guaranteeing basic rights and liberties or for the investigation of crime, must be laid down by an Act. 10. Section 16 of the Police Act (poliisilaki, polislagen, Act no. 493/1995) provides the following: “On the order of a commanding police officer, and in urgent cases even without such an order, police officers have the right to enter a building, other domestic premises or a vehicle if there is good reason to assume that an act or event causing a serious threat to life, personal liberty or health, or notable damage to property or the environment is taking place or about to take place. A further precondition is that the measure is essential to prevent danger or to search and take possession of explosives, weapons or other dangerous substances or objects.” 11. Chapter 5, section 1, subsection 1, of the Coercive Measures Act (pakkokeinolaki, tvångsmedelslagen, Act no. 646/2003) provides that a search may be conducted, inter alia, if there is reason to suspect that an offence has been committed and provided the maximum sentence applicable exceeds six months’ imprisonment. 12. In order for an object to qualify for seizure there must be a reason to presume that it may serve as evidence in criminal proceedings, that it may have been removed from someone as a result of a criminal offence or that the court may order its forfeiture (Chapter 4, section 1, of the Coercive Measures Act). 13. A civil servant having the power to arrest a person may decide to conduct a search at a person’s home. A police officer may conduct a search even without a warrant if it is intended, inter alia, to locate a person to be apprehended, arrested or detained or for seizure of an object that has been used immediately before in a crime. A police officer may conduct a search without a warrant also on other occasions if the matter cannot wait (Chapter 5, section 3). 14. At the time of the events there was no access to a court as concerned a search but only in respect of a seizure (Chapter 4, section 16, subsection 1). 15. According to Chapter 21, section 6, subsection 1, of the Penal Code (rikoslaki, strafflagen, Act no. 578/1995 as modified by Act no. 654/2001), a person can be sentenced for aggravated assault to imprisonment for a minimum term of one year and a maximum of ten years.",0,782

On 2 December 1994 the applicant filed an action with the Vienna Labour and Social Court (Arbeits- und Sozialgericht) against her employer, the General Accident Insurance Company (Allgemeine Unfallversicherungsanstalt). She requested the Court to order her employer to annul her transfer from one department of the hospital where she was working as a nurse to another department. 7. On 15 May 1995 the Social and Labour Court granted the applicant's action by a judgment in default (Versäumungsurteil) and ordered the defendant to reimburse the applicant's costs, i.e. 33,658 Austrian Schillings (ATS). 8. On 31 May 1995 the General Accident Insurance Company filed an appeal against the costs order (Kostenrekurs). It submitted that the costs had not been calculated correctly under the Act on Lawyers' Fees (Rechtsanwaltstarifgesetz) and requested their reduction. This appeal was not transmitted to the applicant. 9. On 19 July 1995 the Vienna Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht), sitting in camera, granted the appeal, recalculated the costs to be reimbursed and reduced them to ATS 14,754.",1,168

The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) are represented by their Agent, Mr Yuriy Zaytsev. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 2 December 1994 the applicant bought a flat belonging to a certain I. For the seller’s part, the contract was signed by a certain G. acting as I.’s agent. On March 1995 I. instituted proceedings in the Minskyy District Court of Kyiv (the “Minskyy court”) against the applicant seeking invalidation of the above contract of sale, alleging that it had been concluded without his knowledge and against his will. The applicant, in his turn, lodged a counter-claim for eviction of I. from the flat. In a judgment of 25 April 1996 the court found for I. On 24 July 1996 the Kyiv City Court (the “Kyiv court”) upheld that judgment. On 4 February 1997 the Deputy President of the Supreme Court, following the applicant’s request, lodged a protest with the Presidium of the Kyiv court, seeking initiation of supervisory review proceedings in the case. On 3 March 1997 the Presidium allowed the protest, quashed the decisions of 25 April and 24 July 1996, and remitted the case for fresh consideration. On 15 December 1998 the Minskyy court found for I. By a ruling of 29 January 1999 it rejected the applicant’s objections as to the accuracy of the minutes of the court hearings. On 25 October 1999 the Deputy Prosecutor of Kyiv, following the applicant’s request, lodged a protest with the Presidium of the Kyiv court, seeking initiation of supervisory review proceedings in the case. It remains unknown whether the Presidium considered the merits of the protest. On 24 November 1999 the Minskyy court quashed the ruling of 29 January 1999 in the light of unspecified newly discovered circumstances, and accepted the applicant’s objections to the minutes of the court hearings, which had previously been rejected. It also quashed the judgment of 15 December 1998. On 31 October 2000 the Minskyy court granted the applicant’s counterclaim and ordered I.’s eviction from the flat. On 22 November 2000 the court adopted a supplementary decision by which it rejected the applicant’s claim seeking to invalidate I.’s ownership certificate received in 1994. On the same date, the court referred the applicant’s criminal complaint against I. to the prosecution. On 27 December 2000 the Kyiv court upheld the judgment of 31 October 2000, but quashed the ruling of 22 November 2000 and partially amended the supplementary decision adopted on the same day. On 15 March 2001 I. was evicted from the disputed flat. On 19 April 2001 the Chairman of the Kyiv court lodged a supervisory review protest with the same court, seeking re-examination of the case. He submitted, inter alia, that the courts had failed to give due regard to I.’s references to the ongoing criminal investigations into the matter. On 24 April 2001 the applicant sold the flat to a certain M. On 28 May 2001 the Presidium of the Kyiv court allowed the above supervisory review protest and quashed the decisions of 31 October and 27 December 2000, remitting the case to the Minskyy court for further consideration. On 11 October 2001 a three-judge panel of the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s appeal in cassation against the above ruling of the Presidium of the Kyiv court. On 8 February 2002 the applicant unsuccessfully requested the Kyiv City Court of Appeal (“the Kyiv Court of Appeal”), which was examining the case in the first instance, to suspend the proceedings pending the outcome of the criminal investigation. In a judgment of 25 April 2002 the Kyiv Court of Appeal decided in the applicant’s favour. On 19 February 2003 the Supreme Court upheld the judgment.

The applicant’s mother died on 1 May 1994 and inheritance proceedings were opened before the Stari Grad Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Starom Gradu). 6. On 8 June 1999 the court issued a decision distributing the property between the applicant and his brother. The relevant part of that decision reads: ... the land registry division of this court shall register the ownership of the heirs [listed above], once [that part of the decision] becomes final... 7. Subsequently, the applicant’s brother lodged an appeal against that decision complaining about the ruling on the costs of the proceedings. 8. On 12 April 2002 the Split County Court (Županijski sud u Splitu) declared the appeal inadmissible. The decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 22 May 2002. 9.

On 19 July 1966 the applicant and his wife obtained a divorce decree. On 5 November 1975 the applicant’s ex-wife filed with the Bydgoszcz District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) a petition for division of the matrimonial property. On 16 October 1978 the Bydgoszcz District Court gave a decision. Both parties appealed. On 30 May 1979 the Bydgoszcz Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) quashed the first-instance decision and remitted the case. In 1982 the applicant’s ex-wife donated her share in the disputed property to A.H. and E.H., who became parties to the proceedings. On 2 December 1990 the applicant sent a letter to the Minister of Justice, complaining about the slow progress of the proceedings. On 15 February 1991, in reply to his complaints, the President of the Bydgoszcz Regional Court acknowledged that the proceedings were indeed lengthy. Prior to 1 May 1993, the Bydgoszcz District Court held a number of hearings and obtained several expert reports. On 2 October 1996 the Bydgoszcz District Court gave a decision. The court granted ownership of the entire property (plot of land and a house) to A.H. and E.H. The court also ordered them to pay off the applicant’s share in the estate. On 5 June 1997, on the applicant’s appeal, the Bydgoszcz Regional Court partly amended the first-instance decision. On 19 September 1997 the applicant lodged a cassation appeal. In March 1998 A.H. and E.H. sold their share in the property to a certain J.S.

822,822,"1. The present case was referred to the Court by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany (""the Government"") in September 1982 and then by the European Commission of Human Rights (""the Commission"") in October 1982. The case originated in an application (no. 8544/79) against that State lodged with the Commission on 14 February 1979 by a Turkish national, Mr. Abdulbaki Öztürk. 2. The Chamber constituted to hear the case relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the plenary Court on 27 May 1983 (Rule 48 of the Rules of Court). By a judgment delivered on 21 February 1984, the Court held that there had been a breach of Article 6 para. 3 (e) (art. 6-3-e) of the Convention in that the applicant had not received the free assistance of an interpreter during proceedings before the Heilbronn District Court (Series A no. 73, paragraphs 57-58 of the reasoning and point 2 of the operative provisions, pp. 22-23). The only outstanding matter to be settled is the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) in the present case. Accordingly, as regards the facts, the Court will confine itself here to giving the pertinent details; for further particulars, reference should be made to paragraphs 9 to 41 of the above-mentioned judgment (pp. 8-16). 3. At the hearings held on 25 May 1983, Mr. Wingerter, counsel for the applicant, had sought, by way of just satisfaction for his client, reimbursement of interpretation fees of DM 63.90 and payment of lawyer’s costs incurred before the Convention institutions; as to the amount of the latter costs, he had stated that he left the decision to the discretion of the Court (ibid., p. 22, paragraph 59 of the reasoning). The Government had not taken a stand on the matter (ibid.). In its judgment of 21 February 1984, the Court reserved the whole of the question (ibid., paragraph 60 of the reasoning and point 3 of the operative provisions, pp. 22-23); the same day, it referred the question back to the Chamber under Rule 50 para. 4 of the Rules of Court. 4. The President of the Chamber, to whom the Chamber had delegated the power to fix the further procedure, obtained, through the Deputy Registrar, the views of the Agent of the Government and of the Delegates of the Commission. On 2 March 1984, he directed that the Agent should have until 16 March 1984 to file her comments and that the Delegates should then have one month within which to reply in writing. The Registrar received the Government’s memorial on 15 March. The Delegates’ memorial was lodged on 18 May, following an extension of the time-limit granted by the President of the Chamber on 9 May. On 16 August, the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the applicant’s lawyer had notified him of his claims and comments by telephone and not in writing, as he had been requested to do. 5. Mr. B. Walsh, substitute judge, replaced Mr. J. Pinheiro Farinha, who was prevented from taking further part in the consideration of the case (Rules 22 para. 1 and 24 para. 1). 6. After consulting the Agent of the Government and the Delegates of the Commission through the Deputy Registrar, the Chamber decided on 24 September that there was no need to hold a hearing.",0,553
824,824,"The applicant, Mr Philip Alderson, is a British national who was born in 1952 and lives in Newport. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr D. Walton of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 4 February 2002, the applicant received a letter from the West Mercia Constabulary asking him to provide information about who was driving his car on 31 January 2002 when it failed to comply with the speed limit. The letter also stated that the police intended to prosecute the driver and that failing to supply information as to the driver was a criminal offence under section 172 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. The applicant replied that he was responding under duress and that he was the driver. On 18 September 2002, before the Magistrates’ Court, the applicant pleaded not guilty to the speeding offence and the prosecution sought to rely on his admission. The Magistrates rejected the applicant’s arguments that the use of the confession violated the Convention. He was convicted of speeding and fined GBP 125, with GBP 263 costs and three penalty points endorsed on his licence. The relevant domestic law and practice is set out in O’Halloran and Francis v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 15809/02 and 25624/02, §§ 2531, ECHR 2007...",0,230
828,828,"5. The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Sofia. 6. In 2004 a real estate agent brought a private prosecution against the applicant for insult and defamation punishable by a fine and public reprimand. According to the complaint, in a newspaper announcement the applicant, describing herself as “the deceived citizen”, warned the public that the real estate agent would buy their real estate at very low prices and then would resell it for much larger amounts, making a very large profit for herself. 7. The Asenovgrad District Court postponed hearings scheduled for 20 September and 11 November 2004 because the applicant had submitted medical certificates and had expressed the wish to participate in the proceedings in person. 8. At hearings conducted on 10 January and 10 March 2005 the applicant was not present but was represented by counsel. 9. At a hearing on 27 May 2005 neither the applicant nor her lawyer appeared. The applicant had submitted a medical certificate and had requested postponement. The District Court noted that the applicant’s presence was not mandatory, but postponed the hearing as her lawyer was also absent. It imposed a fine of 500 Bulgarian levs (BGN) on the applicant’s lawyer. The latter appealed to the Plovdiv Regional Court, arguing that she had also been ill, and submitted a medical certificate. On 3 June 2005 the District Court, applying the procedure of Article 347 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, revoked its own decision, stating that the applicant’s lawyer had given valid reasons for her absence. 10. At a hearing on 27 June 2005 the applicant appeared, but stated that she would make submissions at the final pleading stage. 11. The applicant requested postponement of the hearings scheduled for 15 December 2005, 27 February, 18 May and 19 June 2006, stating that she wanted to address the court but was ill, as was documented by medical certificates she had submitted. The District Court granted her requests. 12. On an unspecified date in September 2006 the applicant submitted to the District Court another medical certificate prescribing her home treatment for hypertension from 15 to 20 September 2006, and requested postponement. 13. At a hearing on 18 September 2006, held in the applicant’s absence but in the presence of her lawyer, the District Court noted the applicant’s statement that she wanted to make submissions at the final stage of the pleadings and found that her hypertension was not an obstacle in this respect. It further noted that the applicant had submitted medical certificates on a number of occasions, thus causing delays in the proceedings. Relying on the Convention, the District Court observed that it was necessary to complete the proceedings within a reasonable time and held that the applicant should therefore be brought before it for the next hearing with the assistance of the police. It did not specify any legal ground for this order. It scheduled the next hearing for 19 October 2006 at 3 p.m. Since the applicant’s lawyer was present at the hearing, the applicant was considered duly informed of the order. 14. Around 10 a.m. on 18 October 2006 the applicant was detained by the police and taken to Sofia Prison, where she remained until the next morning. The applicant contends that the conditions there were humiliating and that she had to use the same toilet as male detainees. 15. In the morning of 19 October 2006 the applicant was escorted by train and car from Sofia to Asenovgrad (160 km), attended the hearing at 3 p.m. and made submissions, after which she was released. In a judgment of the same date the District Court acquitted her, finding that her newspaper announcement had been neither insulting nor defamatory. The plaintiff requested judicial review of the judgment but on 4 December 2006 her appeal was rejected for procedural flaws. 16. Pursuant to Article 269 (1) of the 2006 Code of Criminal Procedure (“the 2006 CCP”), the attendance of the accused person at the trial is mandatory where the charges concern offences punishable by more than five years’ imprisonment. In all other cases, the court may order the accused person to appear if this is necessary for establishing the truth (Article 269 (2) of the 2006 CCP). 17. An accused person may be taken into custody in order to secure his attendance for questioning if he has failed to appear without valid reasons, provided that his attendance is mandatory or is deemed necessary by the competent authority (Article 71(1) of the 2006 CCP). The accused may be taken into custody without prior notice if he has absconded or has no permanent address (Article 71(2) of the 2006 CCP). 18. Orders under Articles 269(2) and 71 of the 2006 CCP are not amenable to appeal before a higher court. 19. Pursuant to Article 347 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, in force until 29 April 2006, the court could revoke its own procedural order if judicial review had been requested. This provision was superseded by Article 344 of the 2006 CCP, in force since 29 April 2006, which repeats its text almost verbatim. 20. The 1988 State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act (the “SMRDA”) provides for compensation in certain cases of deprivation of liberty ordered by a court or by investigating or prosecuting authorities, where the relevant decision or order has been set aside “for lack of lawful grounds” under domestic law. Deprivation of liberty aiming at securing the accused’s attendance at a hearing is not among those cases. 21. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning State liability for damage in connection with conditions of detention have been summarised in the Court’s judgment in the case of Slavcho Kostov v. Bulgaria (no. 28674/03, § 19-22, 27 November 2008).",1,960
829,829,"The applicants, Mr Ağa Hakan, Mr Abdulkerim Hakan, Mr Abdullah Hakan and Mr Abdulhekim Hakan, are Turkish nationals. They are represented before the Court by Mr Bekir Kaya, a lawyer practising in İstanbul. The facts of the cases, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. Until 1997 the applicants lived in Yanıkçay, a village of the Gevaş district in Van. It is to be noted that the applicants did not submit any certificate attesting their ownership of property in Yanıkçay. On 10 October 1997 the applicants left their village due to pressure from the security forces. On 13 December 1997 the security forces set fire to the houses and livestock of the applicants. Two inhabitants of Yanıkçay, Mr Muzaffer Şeker and Mr Mustafa Ülger witnessed the incident. On an unknown date, approximately twenty villagers from Yanıkçay were required to go to the District Gendarmerie Command in Gevaş. They were then compelled to sign statements that the houses had been burned by members of the PKK (Kurdish Workers’ Party). On 16 December 1997 Mr Ağa Hakan, Mr Abdulkerim Hakan and Mr Abdullah Hakan filed a petition with the Public Prosecutor’s office in Gevaş, complaining about the destruction of their property and requestiong redress for the damages they had suffered. On 17 March 1998 the Gevaş Public Prosecutor issued a permenant search warrant to find the perpetrators of the burning down of the applicants’ property. On 15 October 2001 the District Gendarmerie Command in Gevaş informed the Public Prosecutor’s office in Gevaş that the perpetrators of the offence had been neither identified nor captured. On 25 October 2001 Mr Ağa Hakan, Mr Abdulkerim Hakan and Mr Abdullah Hakan filed further petitions with the Public Prosecutor’s office in Gevaş and the Governor’s office in Van reiterating their demand for redress for the damage they had suffered. On 26 October 2001 the Public Prosecutor’s office in Gevaş sent the permanent search warrant and the Gevaş District Gendarmerie Command’s letter of 15 October 2001 to the applicants. The investigation carried out by the authorities indicated that the applicants had left their village of their own will. Statements taken from the applicants’ fellow villagers established that the security forces had not forced the applicants to leave their village. The applicants had left their village, taking their all belongings with them, two months before the burning of their houses. In their petitions filed with the Gevaş Public Prosecutor’s office and in their statements to the Public Prosecutor, the applicants never claimed that they had been forcibly evicted by the security forces. Two eye-witnesses to the burning of the applicants’ houses stated that they had not seen anybody suspicious who could have perpetrated the burning down of the applicants’ abandoned houses. However, a former PKK militant A.U. stated that the houses had been burned by the PKK for revenge from the inhabitants of the Yanıkçay village. Currently there was no obstacle preventing villagers from returning to their homes and possessions in their villages. Persons who had left their villages as a result of terrorism had already started returning and regaining their activities in their villages. On 14 July 2004 the Law on Compensation for Losses resulting from Terrorism and the Fight against Terrorism was passed by the Grand National Assembly and entered into force on 27 July 2004 (“Compensation Law”). That Law provided for a sufficient remedy capable of redressing the Convention grievances of persons who were denied access to their possessions in their villages. In that connection Damage Assessment and Compensation Commissions were set up in seventy-six provinces. Persons who had suffered damage as a result of terrorism or of measures taken by the authorities to combat terrorism could lodge an application with the relevant compensation commission claiming compensation. The number of persons applying to these commissions had already attained approximately 170,000. A further 800 persons, whose applications were pending before the Court, had also applied to the compensation commissions. Many villagers had already been awarded compensation for the damage they had sustained. A description of the relevant domestic law can be found in the Court’s decision of İçyer v. Turkey (no. 18888/02, §§ 44-54, 12 January 2006) and in its judgment of Doğan and Others v. Turkey (nos. 88038811/02, 8813/02 and 8815-8819/02, §§ 31-35, ECHR 2004-VI).",0,713
830,830,"7. The applicant was born in 1945 and resides in the city of Donetsk, Ukraine. 8. The applicant has worked as an English teacher in a secondary school since 1984. 9. On 23 March 1996 the Ukrainian Parliament adopted a new wording for the Education Act that provided for, in particular, the payment of certain benefits to teachers. 10. On 2 April 1999 the applicant instituted civil proceedings in the Leninsky District Court of Donetsk against the Leninsky District Department for Education, claiming entitlement to those benefits. The applicant maintained that he had more than 10 years’ of service and was thus entitled to a 20% increase in his salary as from 1 January 1997. However, the defendant had not paid him this increase. He further maintained that the defendant had not paid him annual bonuses for excellent work and recreation. The defendant stated that the claimed amounts could not be paid because the State budgets for 1997-1999 did not make any provision for such expenditures. 11. On 5 October 1999 the court found in part for the applicant. The court rejected the applicant’s claim for an excellent work bonus as such a payment required an assessment of the applicant’s work which was outside the court’s competence. The court also rejected the applicant’s claim for unpaid benefits in 1997 and 1998 as being out of time, according to the law on employment disputes. The court further rejected the applicant’s claim for benefits after 1 June 1999 as the Secondary Education Act, adopted in May 1999, had suspended them. The court, however, awarded the applicant the claimed increase in salary for the period between 1 January and 1 June 1999. 12. The applicant appealed against this decision to the Donetsk Regional Court. 13. On 4 November 1999 the regional court quashed the decision of the first instance court and remitted the case for a fresh consideration. The court noted, in particular, that the Secondary Education Act had entered into force on 23 June 1999; therefore the first instance court had erroneously overlooked the period between 1 and 23 June 1999. 14. On 24 February 2000 the Leninsky District Court of Donetsk ruled against the applicant. The court found that, under the transitional clauses of the Secondary Education Act, the provision entitling the applicant to benefits would only resume force on 1 September 2001. Thus, at the time of the examination of the claim, there was no legal basis for it. 15. On 30 March 2000, the Donetsk Regional Court upheld the decision of the first instance court. It observed that the claims of the applicant for the periods prior to the adoption of the Secondary Education Act could not be satisfied, since at the time of the consideration of the case the relevant provisions of the Education Act had been suspended by the Secondary Education Act. This decision was final. 16. At the material time, Article 233 of the Labour Code of Ukraine provided that employees could institute proceedings in respect of an employment dispute within three months from the date on which they learned or could have been expected to learn that there had been an infringement of their rights. By an Act of 11 July 2001, this article was supplemented by a provision repealing time-limits for disputes concerning salary arrears. 17. Article 57 of the Education (Amendment) Act 1996 provided for a 20% increase in salary for teachers who had worked in the education system for more than 10 years. The same article provided for an annual payment for recreation and an annual bonus for the performance of excellent work. Between 23 June 1999 and 1 September 2001 these provisions were suspended by the Secondary Education Act mentioned below. 18. The second paragraph of Article 43 of the Secondary Education Act of 13 May 1999 provided that teachers of State and municipal secondary schools would be paid their salaries and benefits under Article 57 of the Education Act out of the State Budget of Ukraine. The transitional clause of the former Act stipulated that Article 43 would enter into force on 1 September 2001.",0,685
833,833,"The applicant, Mr Erol Direkçi, is a Turkish national who was born in 1950 and lives in Ankara. He was represented before the Court by Mr L. Kanat, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purpose of the proceedings before the Court. On 15 October 1995 the applicant’s son, Erkut Direkçi, participated in a demonstration organised by a trade union in Ankara. On the same day he was taken into custody. On 27 October 1995 he was brought before the Ankara State Security Court which ordered his detention on remand. On an unspecified date the Public Prosecutor at the Ankara State Security Court filed a bill of indictment, charging Erkut Direkçi under Article 168 § 2 of the Criminal Code with membership of an illegal organisation, namely the MLKP (the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party). On 10 September 1996 Erkut Direkçi’s lawyer submitted a petition to the Ankara State Security Court for the establishment by the Ankara Numune Hospital of a medical report on his client’s state of health. Between 10 and 16 September 1996 Erkut Direkçi was examined at the Ankara Numune Hospital and diagnosed with liver cancer. The medical reports submitted by the applicant confirm the diagnosis. The applicant also submitted two medical reports recommending one or two months’ rest for his son. On 17 September 1996 Erkut Direkçi’s lawyer requested the Ankara State Security Court to release his client on account of his serious illness. On the same day the Ankara State Security Court ordered Erkut Direkçi’s release pending trial. On 4 February 1997 the Ankara State Security Court convicted Erkut Direkçi of membership of the MLKP under Article 168 § 2 of the Criminal Code and sentenced him to 12 years and 6 months’ imprisonment. The Court also ordered his detention in his absence. On 5 February 1997 Erkut Direkçi’s lawyer lodged an appeal against the decision regarding his client’s detention. On the same day the Ankara State Security Court dismissed the appeal, taking into account the serious nature of the offence. In August 1997 Erkut Direkçi left for Germany in order to obtain medical treatment. On 24 September 1997 his lawyer requested the Court of Cassation to quash the judgment and the detention order of the Ankara State Security Court. On 6 November 1997 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the Ankara State Security Court. Erkut Direkçi died in Germany on 12 December 1997.",0,409

In February 1992 the applicant brought an action against a limited liability company before the Bács-Kiskun County Regional Court, requesting the court to order the respondent to pay him fee for using his real estate. 6. The Regional Court suspended the proceedings on three occasions for several years, pending the outcome of separate legal disputes related to the ownership of the real estate. The applicant’s requests to have the proceedings resumed were dismissed. 7. On 22 June 2006 the Regional Court delivered judgment, finding partly for the applicant. In the absence of appeals, the judgment became final on 17 July 2006.",1,113
850,850,"The applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Preserje. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr L. Bembič, State Attorney-General. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 18 November 1985 the applicant’s daughter S.F. made a contract of purchase with a company named Stanovanjska zadruga SCT (“SCT”) to buy a house which SCT was planning to build. S.F. later divorced and changed her name to S.B. On 29 January 1988 the applicant and her husband instituted civil proceedings on behalf of their daughter (“the plaintiff”) in the Ljubljana Basic Court (Temeljno sodišče v Ljubljani) requesting that SCT comply with the contract and seeking damages for non-completion. They had legal representation in these proceedings. On 7 March 1989, after two hearings were held, the court issued an interim judgment upholding S.F.’s claim on the merits. On 29 March 1989 SCT lodged an appeal with the Ljubljana Higher Court (Višje sodišče v Ljubljani). On 25 October 1989 the court allowed the appeal and set aside the first-instance court’s judgment as it was premature. In order to estimate the amount of damage incurred by the plaintiff, the first-instance court appointed two experts in construction engineering, one of whom was subsequently replaced by another expert. Until 28 June 1994, the day the Convention took effect with respect to Slovenia, the court held three hearings. On 1 January 1995 the reform of the Slovenian judicial system took effect and the case was transferred to the Ljubljana Local Court (Okrajno sodišče v Ljubljani). On 13 December 1995 the plaintiff requested that a date be scheduled for a hearing. On 5 November 1996 the court held a hearing. On 8 January 1997 the court, upon the plaintiff’s request, appointed a new expert in construction engineering who delivered an expert opinion on 4 November 1997. On 7 April 1998 the court held a hearing where the plaintiff increased her claim. As a result, SCT raised an objection to the amendment, arguing that the claim was barred by prescription (zastaranje). It also objected to the subject-matter jurisdiction of the court. The latter dismissed the objections in a separate decision issued that same day. On 29 May 1998 SCT appealed against this decision to the Ljubljana Higher Court. On 25 November 1998 the court allowed the appeal, set aside the contested decision and remitted the case to the first-instance court for fresh examination. On 1 October 1999 the Ljubljana Local Court held a hearing and declared the case out of its jurisdiction. It transferred the case to the Ljubljana District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Ljubljani). On 11 June 2001 the Ljubljana District Court held a hearing and heard one of the appointed experts. On 22 June 2001 the court sought additional information from the appointed expert which he provided five days later. On 5 July 2001 the court held a hearing. SCT informed the court that bankruptcy proceedings had been instituted against it. The court decided to issue a written judgment. The judgment, upholding S.B.’s claim in part, was served on the plaintiff on 24 September 2001. On 21 November 2001 the applicant’s lawyer also received a copy of the judgment. On 30 October 2001 the judgment of 5 July 2001 became final.",0,547
852,852,"The applicant, Mr Musa Güney, is a Swedish citizen who was born in 1960. He was represented before the Court by Mr R. Armholt, a lawyer practising in Stockholm. The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C.-H. Ehrenkrona, Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The Tax Authority made a tax audit of a restaurant business, owned by a holding company owned, in its turn, by the applicant and three other persons. Following the audit the Tax Authority, by decisions of 8 December 2004, raised the company’s turnover by 2.7 million Swedish kronor (SEK) and considered that SEK 1.9 million of that amount had been paid to the company owners during the tax assessment years 2002 and 2003. Consequently, by the same decisions, the applicant’s taxable income for both years was raised by SEK 236,581. Moreover, as the revised taxation involved a discretionary assessment due to allegedly undisclosed salary payments in the applicant’s tax returns, tax surcharges (skattetillägg) were imposed on him, amounting to SEK 30,078 and 25,886, respectively, for the two assessment years (in total approximately 6,000 euros (EUR)). The applicant appealed to the County Administrative Court (länsrätten) of the County of Stockholm through his legal counsel. On 14 March 2005 the Tax Authority reconsidered its decisions but did not change them. On 31 August 2005 the applicant applied to the County Administrative Court for legal aid. Referring to Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention, he maintained that he had no financial means to pay for legal representation as he had not been granted a respite to pay the tax amounts, that the legal issues were not uncomplicated as statistical information concerning the Swedish restaurant business had been used in determining the revised taxes and that the tax surcharges imposed on him were considerable. He further stated that, being of foreign origin, he did not fully master the Swedish language. On 8 September 2005 the court refused the applicant legal aid. It noted that, under the terms of the Legal Aid Act (Rättshjälpslagen, 1996:1619), the scope for granting legal aid to a businessman in a taxation case was very limited. According to a leading decision by the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsrätten), the application of Article 6 § 3 (c) in a case concerning tax surcharges would depend on the size of the surcharges and the nature of the case; only if the penalties were particularly heavy and the legal issues complicated could legal aid be granted by virtue of the Convention (RÅ 2003 ref. 56). The instant case concerned mainly the question whether the documentation obtained by the Tax Authority constituted a sufficient ground for increasing the first applicant’s liability to income tax. The court found that, although the documentation was relatively extensive, the legal issues, including those related to the subordinate questions concerning the tax surcharges, were not of such a character that the applicant had a right to legal aid under Swedish law or the Convention. On 18 October 2005 the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarrätten) in Stockholm rejected the applicant’s appeal, subscribing to the reasons given by the County Administrative Court. On 5 April 2006 the Supreme Administrative Court refused leave to appeal. By a judgment of 3 January 2007, the County Administrative Court reduced the company’s unrecorded revenues and salary payments. Accordingly, in a further judgment of 16 March 2007 the court lowered the applicant’s taxable income to SEK 125,008 for each of the assessment years. In consequence of this finding, the tax surcharges were also reduced, to SEK 14,495 and 12,614, respectively, for the two assessment years (in total approximately EUR 3,000). The court also decided that the applicant be compensated for litigation costs under the Act on Compensation for Costs and Expenses in Cases Concerning Taxes, etc. (Lagen om ersättning för kostnader i ärenden och mål om skatt, m.m., 1989:479). The applicant was awarded SEK 825 concerning the court proceedings and SEK 1,000 concerning the proceedings before the Tax Authority (in total about EUR 200). He had claimed SEK 825 and 3,500, respectively. The applicant appealed against the taxation and the tax surcharges to the Administrative Court of Appeal, where the case was still pending at the time of the present decision.",0,717
853,853,"The applicant is a Portuguese national who was born in 1953 and lives in Lisbon. He is represented before the Court by Mr A. Fialho Pinto, a lawyer practising in Lisbon. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In 1997 the applicant, a wing commander in the airforce, was a military attaché at the Portuguese Embassy in Guinea-Bissau. On 20 February 1997 the chief liaison officer for military attachés informed the Armed Forces General Staff that the applicant had been absent from duty, without leave and using an official vehicle, for four days. On 25 February 1997 the Armed Forces Chief of Staff ordered disciplinary proceedings to be brought against the applicant and appointed an officer to conduct the investigation. On 26 February 1997 the investigating officer sent the applicant a copy of the chief liaison officer’s report with a request for his comments, which the applicant sent him on 7 March 1997. On 14 March 1997 the investigating officer heard evidence from the chief liaison officer in the applicant’s absence. On 30 April 1997 the investigating officer lodged submissions accusing the applicant of dereliction of duty contrary to paragraphs 25 and 34 of Article 4 of the Military Disciplinary Regulations (unauthorised use of a military vehicle and absence without leave), aggravated by circumstances set out in subparagraphs (b) and (h) of Article 71 of the Regulations (the breach of regulations had occurred overseas and had been detrimental to the service). In his reply lodged on 16 May 1997 the applicant gave the names of three witnesses from whom, he said, the investigating officer should take statements. On an unspecified date the investigating officer declared the investigation to be at an end and sent his report to the Armed Forces Chief of Staff. On 23 May 1997 the Chief of Staff found the applicant guilty of the alleged offences and sentenced him to five days’ detention. The applicant requested the Chief of Staff to review that decision on the grounds that there had been a breach of the adversarial principle. By an order of 19 June 1997 the Chief of Staff granted the request in part and ordered the investigating officer to take evidence from the witnesses whose names had been provided by the applicant. The investigating officer heard the three witnesses concerned in the absence of the applicant and his representatives between 13 and 18 June 1997. In his report dated 18 June to the Chief of Staff, he indicated that the statements of the witnesses did not alter his earlier conclusions. By an order of 18 June 1997 the Chief of Staff upheld the sentence of five days’ detention, which had been served by the applicant in the meantime. On an unspecified date the applicant appealed against that decision to the Courts Martial Appeal Court (Supremo Tribunal Militar). He alleged among other things a violation of his defence rights and of the adversarial principle. In that connection, he complained that he had not been permitted to question the witnesses whose names he had given, either in person or through his representative. On 30 October 1997 the Courts Martial Appeal Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. With regard to the adversarial principle, it said, inter alia: “Certainly, military disciplinary proceedings, which are not criminal proceedings, are governed subsidiarily by the procedural provisions of the Code of Military Justice, and in particular those guaranting the rights of the defence. However, criminal proceedings comprise two distinct stages: the investigation stage, which is governed by the inquisitorial principle, and the trial stages, which is subject to the adversarial principle. During the investigative stage, the accused’s representative is not entitled to question or contradict witnesses. He is restricted to requesting them to give evidence on certain factual matters before the investigating [officer]. For that reason, there has been no breach of the adversarial principle, which is inapplicable to that stage of the proceedings...” The Courts Martial Appeal Court went on to hold that the mitigating circumstance pleaded by the applicant, namely his co-operation in uncovering the truth, was not to be taken into consideration. Detention or a ban on leave (detençao ou probiçao de saída) is a penalty laid down by Article 26 of the Military Disciplinary Regulations (adopted by Legislative-Decree No. 142/77 of 9 April 1997), which provides, inter alia: “1. Detention or a ban on leave shall consist of the confinement of the person punished to barracks or aboard ship throughout the term of the sentence. The person punished shall not be exempted from military training or the performance of rota (escala) duties. ...” The sentence may not exceed ten days in the case of officers. As to its effects, Article 53 lays down that the person concerned shall lose one day of seniority rights for every four days’ detention. The Military Disciplinary Regulations also lay down other sentences, notably disciplinary imprisonment and aggravated disciplinary imprisonment. Disciplinary imprisonment means detention in suitable premises. However, the serviceman may be called on to perform any work required of him between morning and evening (Article 27). Aggravated disciplinary imprisonment means detention in a prison.",0,857
855,855,"The applicant, Mr Bernd Schaedel, is a German national who was born in 1941 and lives in Berlin. He was represented before the Court by Ms M. Biedermann-Weist, a lawyer practising in Berlin. The applicant was a citizen of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) who absconded to West Berlin in May 1988. His real property was subsequently placed under GDR State guardianship and sold to members of the GDR nomenclature (hereinafter the “occupiers”) in December 1988. The occupiers were registered as owners of the property on 2 January 1989 and lived in the house built on the property. On 13 August 1990 the applicant applied for the restitution of the property. On 25 July 1996 the Hellersdorf-Hohenschönhausen-Marzahn Office for the Regulation of Outstanding Property Issues (Amt zur Regelung offener Vermögensfragen) decided, inter alia, that the occupiers had not acquired the property in good faith and ordered that the property be returned. The occupiers appealed against that decision. On 7 March 2002 the Berlin Administrative Court ordered the return of the property to the applicant, and from that date the applicant was the owner of the property. The occupiers withdrew their application for leave to appeal on points of law on an unspecified date and subsequently vacated the property in September 2002. On 29 December 2003 the Berlin Regional Court refused to grant the applicant legal aid for a claim against the occupiers to obtain compensation for use of the property as regards the period from 1990 to September 2002 on the ground that his application had no prospect of success. As to the period from 1990 to 7 March 2002, and relying on a leading judgment of the Federal Court of Justice of 23 April 1999 (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below), the court noted that section 7(7) of the Act on the Regulation of Outstanding Property Issues / Property Act (Gesetz zur Regelung offener Vermögensfragen/ Vermögensgesetz – hereinafter the “Property Act”, see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below) excluded compensation for the remaining period when the occupiers were registered as owners and had used the property solely as a dwelling. Any claim for compensation for use of property for the period between March 2002 and September 2002 could only be raised before a district court in view of the value of the claim. On 10 February 2004 the Berlin Court of Appeal upheld that decision. On 27 September 2004 the Berlin Constitutional Court refused to accept the applicant’s complaint for examination. On 12 January 2005 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to accept the applicant’s constitutional complaint for examination (no. 1 BvR 2852/04). Under section 7(7) of the Property Act, an owner is not entitled to claim compensation for use of property from the tenants unless otherwise agreed or in respect of rent obtained after 1 July 1994. On 23 April 1999 the Federal Court of Justice held in a leading judgment (published in that court’s official reports [BGHZ] volume 141, pp. 232 et seq.) that there were no lacunae in section 7(7) of the Property Act and hence no justification for its analogous application to claims for compensation for use of property other than those concerning rent obtained by the tenant after 1 July 1994. The court noted that the tenant was fully entitled to enjoy the property and its fruits prior to restitution. Citing the relevant legislative materials, the court further noted that the legislature had provided for the exception only to urge occupiers to use the rent to maintain the property prior to restitution.",0,589
861,861,"4. The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Ryazan. 5. On 29 March 2000 the applicant and two other individuals were detained on suspicion of having committed an assault and infliction of grave bodily harm resulting in death. The applicant’s challenge of the custodial measure of restraint was rejected on 11 August 2000. 6. On 8 September 2000 the preliminary investigation was completed. The applicant did not study the case materials as his legal counsel were unable to assist him at the time due to illness and involvement in different proceedings. 7. On 29 September 2000 the applicant signed the undertaking not to leave the town and was released. He and his counsel did not appear at the investigator’s summons to study the case materials. 8. From 12 October to 13 November 2000 the applicant stayed in hospital. Following his and his counsel’s repeated failure to familiarise themselves with the case materials, the investigator set the deadline at 25 April 2001. 9. On 3 May 2001 after finalising the bill of indictment the prosecutor decided again to place the applicant in detention, which was subsequently extended by the court on several occasions and upheld by decisions of 27 February 2003, 4 December 2003, 24 February 2004, 10 June 2004 and 12 August 2004 of the Ryazan Regional Court (“the Regional Court”). 10. The Ryazhskiy District Court of the Ryazan Region received the applicant’s case for examination on 8 May 2001. By decision of 22 May 2001 the court adjourned the proceedings due to the applicant’s illness. 11. The next hearing scheduled for 2 July 2001 did not take place due to the counsels’ failure to appear. 12. At the hearing of 17 July 2001 the applicant requested that he be given one month to study the case-file but could not do so as both of his counsel were on vacation. On 28 September 2001 the court limited the time granted to the applicant to study the case-file by 1 November 2001. 13. The next hearing scheduled for 20 November 2001 did not take place due to the judge’s illness. 14. On 8 January 2002 president of the Ryazhskiy District Court requested that president of the Regional Court assign the applicant’s case to a different trial court due to the fact that the judge who was considering it was ill and the other judges had already taken part in the proceedings in some form and could not examine the case. On 22 January 2002 the applicant’s case was transferred to the Ukholovskiy District Court of the Ryazan Region (“the District Court”). 15. At the next hearing scheduled for 27 February 2002 the court granted the defence’s request for an outpatient psychiatric examination and a graphologic examination. 16. On 20 June 2002 the court commissioned an inpatient psychiatric examination which was held on 2 December 2002. The applicant did not object to the composition of the trial court and did not challenge the judges. 17. Between 14 January 2003 and 14 September 2004 twenty two scheduled hearings did not take place due to the counsels’ failure to appear; on twenty occasions it was the default of the applicant’s counsel. Following the applicant’s refusal to continue examination of the case in his counsel’s absence, on several occasions president of the District Court requested replacement of the counsels at the Tambov and Ryazan regional bars as well as the Ryazan Region Lawyers’ Council. It is not clear whether or when this measure became successful. 18. On 21 September 2004, in presence of the applicant’s legal counsel, the District Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to 13 years’ imprisonment. It also granted the civil suit again him. 19. In his grounds of appeal the applicant challenged the bench which had delivered the conviction alleging defects in the appointment of the lay judges. 20. On 24 February 2005 the Regional Court upheld the judgment on appeal. It also found that the trial court had been composed in accordance with the law and that the applicant had failed to challenge the bench during the trial. 21. Article 50.3 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure of 2001 provides that in the event of a counsel’s failure to appear during 5 days after a motion for legal assistance, the court may invite the accused to retain a different counsel or assign a legal-aid lawyer.",1,731
873,873,"5. The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Timişoara. 6. At the material time he was a journalist at the newspaper Ziua de Vest in Timişoara. 7. On 16 June 2000 the applicant attended an official meeting between the prefect and representatives of the interns from the hospitals in the county who were on strike. Ms C.M.O., one of the interns' representatives, stated: “Because I refused to prostitute myself with Doctor [P.], Professor [D.] dismissed me from the Cardiology Centre.” 8. On 19 June 2000 the newspaper Ziua de Vest published an article by the applicant. The relevant parts read as follows: “Scandal in the medical world in Timişoara The president of the Interns Association in Timiş County, Dr [D.D.], says that 'Dr [P.] behaves in certain ways that we all know' A medical intern from Timişoara, whose name we shall not yet make public, declared on Friday, in front of the prefect [L.B.], that the director of the Timiş Public Health Direction, Dr [P.], had attempted to sexually blackmail her. 'Because I refused to prostitute myself with Doctor [P.], Professor [D.] dismissed me from the Cardiology Centre' declared the intern. The president of the Interns Association in Timişoara, Dr [D.D.], declared that he had not known about this case of sexual harassment, which he learned of only at the meeting with the prefect. 'Dr [P.] behaves in certain ways that we all know' said Dr [D.D.] ... Although we tried to get his comments on the accusations brought against him, Dr [P.] was unavailable.” A photo of P. featured in the article. 9. On 21 June 2000 P. lodged a criminal complaint for defamation against the applicant with Timişoara District Court. His complaint also concerned the company which published the newspaper. 10. The District Court heard evidence from C.M.O., who admitted to having made the assertion reproduced by the applicant but denied having given her permission for its publication. The prefect also confirmed that an intern had accused P. of sexual aggression during the meeting. 11. The applicant was heard by the court on two occasions. He pleaded not guilty and relied in his defence on his right to freedom of expression and the right to provide information about public figures. 12. On 20 March 2001 the District Court gave judgment. It acquitted the applicant on the ground that he had not intended to denigrate P. It found that the expression “sexual harassment” had not harmed P.'s dignity as it was a stylistic choice by the applicant. 13. Both parties appealed to the Timişoara County Court. On 18 May 2001 the court was addressed by the parties' counsels, who defended orally the grounds for their respective appeals. P.'s lawyer asked for the applicant's conviction. The applicant's lawyer and the company's representative requested that P. be compelled to pay court fees. The applicant was invited to speak only before the end of the hearing (ultimul cuvânt al inculpatului). In his address he asked that P.'s appeal be dismissed. 14. The final decision was adopted on the same day. The County Court quashed the judgment of 20 March 2001, re-examined the evidence and found as follows: “[the journalist] did not confine himself to merely providing information about the criticisms [expressed against P.] but added his own appreciation, which went beyond [C.M.O.]'s statements. ... Through its title and content, the article contains untrue statements and allegations and personal appreciations by [the applicant] which, if true, would render the victim liable to a criminal penalty or expose him to public opprobrium. By publishing the victim's photo, and by presenting the information that a scandal had been caused in the Timişoara medical world by [P.]'s behaviour ... [the applicant] acted with intent to denigrate the victim, the article being manifestly defamatory. The words “sexual blackmail and sexual harassment” cannot be regarded as having stylistic and literary value when an individual's image, dignity and honour are at stake.” 15. The County Court noted that a certain degree of aggressiveness was common in journalism. It therefore, although the facts met the legal criteria to constitute the criminal offence of defamation, the acts perpetrated and their consequences were not severe enough to come within the sphere of criminal law. Consequently, it acquitted the applicant and imposed an administrative fine of 500,000 Romanian lei (ROL). The court also found that the conditions had been met for the applicant's civil liability, and that of the publishing company, in respect of the prejudice caused to the victim. In consequence, it ordered the applicant and the company to pay ROL 5,000,000 to P. as compensation for non-pecuniary damage and ROL 2,000,000 for costs. Lastly, it ordered them to pay ROL 50,000 to the State in court fees. 16. On 3 October 2001 the applicant paid the administrative fine. 17. The relevant provisions of the Civil and Criminal Codes concerning insult and defamation and liability for paying damages in force at the material time are described in Barb v. Romania, no. 5945/03, §§ 19-20, 7 October 2008. 18. The Criminal Code has been amended repeatedly and in 2006 the Articles on insult and defamation were repealed (for details, see Cuc Pascu v. Romania, no. 36157/02, §§ 12-14, 16 September 2008). 19. However, in decision no. 62 of 18 January 2007 the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional the removal from the Criminal Code of the Articles on insult and defamation. 20. Law no. 356/2006 amended the Criminal Code and made it mandatory for an appeal court to hear the accused where the first-instance court had acquitted him or her. Currently, where an appeal court quashes a judgment given by a first-instance court, it must decide on the evidence to be adduced and set a date on which it will take a statement from the accused if the latter was not heard or if he or she was acquitted by the first-instance court (Articles 38514 § 11 and 38516, as amended).",1,988
874,874,"1. The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (""the Commission"") and by the Government of the Swiss Confederation (""the Government"") on 25 May and 5 August 1992, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 14518/89) against the Swiss Confederation lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Swiss national, Mrs Margrit Schuler-Zgraggen, on 29 December 1988. 2. In a judgment of 24 June 1993 (""the principal judgment"") the Court found that there had been a breach of Article 14 of the Convention taken together with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 14+6-1), as the assumption that women gave up work when they gave birth to a child had been the sole basis for the reasoning in a judgment of the Federal Insurance Court and had introduced a difference of treatment on the ground of sex only, a difference that lacked any reasonable and objective justification (Series A no. 263, pp. 20-22 and 24, paras. 61-67 and point 5 of the operative provisions). The Court ruled that its judgment constituted in itself sufficient just satisfaction in respect of the alleged non-pecuniary damage and that the respondent State was to pay the applicant, within three months, 7,500 Swiss francs (CHF) in respect of costs and expenses (ibid., pp. 22-24, paras. 69 and 76 and points 6-7 of the operative provisions). 3. As the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) was not ready for decision as regards the pecuniary damage, it was reserved in the principal judgment. The Court invited the Government and the applicant to submit their written observations within six months and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement they might reach (ibid., pp. 23 and 24, para. 74 and point 8 of the operative provisions). 4. On 7 April 1994 the Agent of the Government informed the President that in a judgment of 24 March 1994 the Federal Insurance Court had concluded the rehearing proceedings commenced under section 139a of the Federal Judicature Act. Its own judgment of 21 June 1988 had been set aside, together with the decision of the Canton of Uri Appeals Board for Old Age, Survivors’ and Invalidity Insurance of 8 May 1987 and the decision of the Invalidity Insurance Board of the Canton of Uri of 21 March 1986; and the applicant had been granted a full invalidity pension with effect from 1 May 1986. 5. On 27 April 1994 counsel for the applicant advised the Registrar that his client did not consider that the proceedings in Switzerland were terminated and that she had submitted to the Department of Finance a claim for compensation in the amount of CHF 40,933.64 based on section 3 of the Act on the liability of the Confederation. 6. On 25 May 1994 the Secretariat of the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate wished to leave the question of Article 50 (art. 50) to the Court’s discretion. 7. On 14 September 1994 the applicant’s representative sent the Registrar a copy of the Federal Council’s decision of 12 June 1994 whereby the compensation claim was refused; he asked the Court to consider the possibility of ruling on his client’s claims as an agreement with the Government seemed unlikely. 8. On the President’s instructions, the Registrar consulted the Agent of the Government and the Delegate of the Commission. On 12 October 1994 the Agent said he had nothing to add to the Federal Council’s decision of 12 June 1994. On the following day the Delegate made it known that he was leaving the matter to the Court’s discretion. 9. On 25 October 1994",0,626
880,880,"The applicant, Mr Vadim Viktorovich Vlasenko, is a Ukrainian national who was born in 1962 and lives in Kryvy Rig, Dnipropetrovsk Region, Ukraine. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Y. Zaytsev. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant worked at a joint stock company, “K”. In 1995 he retired. In July 1995 a medical expert commission recognised the applicant as having a number of work-related illnesses. As a result K paid him a lump sum in compensation and started to pay him a monthly pension. On 1 July 1998 the applicant instituted civil proceedings in the Tsentralno-Miskyy District Court of Kryvy Rig (“the District Court”) against K, seeking a recalculation of the above-mentioned payments. On 16 February 1999 the defendant requested the court to order an accountant’s report on the calculation of the payments in question. The court allowed this request. On 1 March 1999 the expert opinion was read out at a court hearing. On 18 March 1999 the District Court found for the applicant. On 25 October 1999, upon an appeal by the defendant, the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Court (since June 2001 the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Court of Appeal) quashed that judgment on the ground that the first-instance court had wrongly calculated the amounts awarded, and ordered a retrial. The District Court’s hearing scheduled for 8 February 2000 was adjourned at the applicant’s request because he was preparing an additional claim. This claim, apparently for additional payments, was lodged on 22 February 2000. Further additional claims were lodged by the applicant on 11 July 2001 and 4 March 2002. On 15 March 2000 the District Court ordered, at the defendant’s request, a forensic examination by an accountant. The defendant subsequently refused to bear the costs of the forensic examination in view of lack of funds and the expert terminated the examination. The file was transferred back to the District Court and the next hearing took place on 9 April 2001. On 17 July 2001 the District Court joined, at the defendant’s request, the local department of the State Social Security Fund (Виконавча дирекція Фонду соціального страхування від нещасних випадків на виробництві і професійних захворювань в м. Кривому Розі) to the proceedings as a co-defendant. On 20 July 2001 the District Court found for the applicant. On 10 January 2002, following an appeal by K, the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of 20 July 2001 on the ground that the lower court had wrongly calculated the amounts awarded and ordered a retrial. On 11 June 2002 the District Court found for the applicant. From 10 July to 31 October 2002 the domestic courts examined the matter of admissibility of the appeal by K against the last-mentioned judgment. Eventually, K lodged an appeal in compliance with the procedural requirements prescribed by law and the proceedings on the merits resumed. On 27 January 2003 the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of 11 June 2002. On 15 December 2003 the Supreme Court of Ukraine rejected an appeal in cassation by K.",0,516

On 5 June 1992 the applicant’s trial started before the Nova Gorica District Court (Okrožno sodišče – “the District Court”). On the same day the case was adjourned. 7. On 16 June 1992 the District Court ordered the redetention of the applicant. 8. On 28 August 1992 a number of witnesses were heard and on 3 September 1992 the District Court again adjourned the applicant’s trial due to the applicant’s illness. 9. By decision of the District Court dated 17 September 1992, the applicant was again released. 10. A hearing scheduled for 28 September 1992 had to be adjourned sine die as the applicant was ill. 11. On 21 July 1992 the applicant was accused of another sexual assault of a minor. An indictment was filed on 18 January 1993. The applicant entered a plea against the indictment which was rejected on 15 February 1993. On 17 March 1993 the District Court joined the two sets of proceedings. 12. On 2 June 1993 the public prosecutor requested further investigations on the ground that there was reasonable suspicion that the applicant had also criminally neglected and ill-treated a minor within the meaning of Article 96 §§ 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code. 13. On 21 October 1993 a preliminary charge was filed in respect of the aforesaid acts. On 28 March 1995 the District Court decided to deal with all charges against the applicant in a single set of proceedings. 14. In the period from 18 February 1997 to 9 July 1997 the District Court held several hearings. 15. On 9 July 1997 the District Court convicted the applicant of sexual offences on several counts. A combined prison sentence of two years and eight months was imposed on the applicant. Both the applicant and the public prosecutor appealed. 16. On 12 February 1998 the Koper High Court (Višje sodišče) rejected the applicant’s appeal and increased the sentence to three years’ imprisonment. 17. On 26 March 1998 the applicant lodged a plea of nullity (zahteva za varstvo zakonitosti). The District Court transmitted it to the Supreme Court (Vrhovno sodišče), together with the file, on 5 June 1998. The Supreme Court dismissed this complaint on 17 September 1998. 18. On 24 March 1998 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the Koper High Court’s judgment of 12 Februrary 1998. It was dismissed by the Constitutional Court (Ustavno sodišče) on 15 June 1998. 19. On 12 October 1998 the applicant filed a further constitutional complaint concerning the Supreme Court’s decision of 17 September 1998 (see paragraph 17 above). He alleged, inter alia, a violation of Article 6 § 3 of the Convention in the criminal proceedings against him. 20. On 1 December 1998 the Constitutional Court refused to send the case back to the lower courts for a new examination as it found no violation of the applicant’s right to a fair hearing.",1,513
885,885,"3. The applicants were born in 1952, 1960, 1962 and 1934 respectively and live in Bursa. 4. In 2004 the General Directorate of Highways seized a plot of land belonging to the applicants without any formal expropriation, for the construction of a highway. The applicants brought an action before the Karacabey Civil Court to obtain compensation for the de facto expropriation of their property. They requested 5,500 Turkish liras (TRY) as compensation from the court and reserved their right to increase this claim in due course. 5. On 22 June 2006 the Karacabey Civil Court awarded the applicants TRY 5,500 as compensation for the de facto expropriation of their land, as requested, plus interest. The applicants initiated execution proceedings before the Bursa Execution Office to obtain that amount (file no. 2009/2802). 6. On 13 March 2007 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court. 7. The applicants subsequently brought an additional action (“ek dava”) before the Karacabey Civil Court to obtain further compensation for their land in the light of the expert report obtained during the previous proceedings, which had valued the land at a rate higher than that initially requested by them. 8. On 24 May 2007 the Karacabey Civil Court awarded the applicants TRY 126,725, plus interest. The applicants initiated another set of execution proceedings before the Bursa Execution Office to obtain the amount awarded (file no. 2007/6192). 9. On 16 October 2007 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the Karacabey Civil Court. 10. On 23 March and 13 November 2009 the administration paid TRY 8,821 and 187,447 respectively to the files before the Bursa Execution Office. 11. According to the information provided by the applicants, there has been no outstanding debt in the execution files.",1,293

By judgment of 16 March 2004, the Justice of Peace in the Varavino-Faktoriya Circuit awarded the applicant 92,073.93 Russian roubles (RUB) against the defendant company. 7. The defendant company appealed. 8. On 16 June 2004, both parties being present in the court-room, the Lomonosovskiy District Court of Arkhangelsk adjourned the hearing until 13 July 2004, which was noted in the minutes. The parties were also notified about the hearing of 13 July 2004 by post, in accordance with the domestic law. However, the court made a mistake in the defendant company's address, which never received the summons. 9. On 13 July 2004 the Lomonosovskiy District Court of Arkhangelsk, in the absence of the defendant company's representative, upheld the judgment on appeal. 10. The defendant company applied for supervisory review of the above judgments. On 21 September 2004 a judge in the Arkhangelsk Regional Court granted it leave for supervisory review. On 29 September 2004 the Presidium of the Regional Court set aside the judgment of 13 July 2004 and ordered a re-examination of the case by the District Court on the grounds that the defendant company had not been informed about the hearing of 13 July 2004. The Presidium found that though the defendant company's representative was present in the court-room when the district court adjourned the hearing to 13 July 2004, the defendant company could not be considered as duly informed about it. 11. On 26 January 2005 the District Court quashed the judgment of 16 March 2004 and awarded the applicant RUB 38,123.85. 12. The relevant domestic law governing the supervisory review procedure at the material time is summed up in the Court's judgment in the case of Kot v. Russia (no. 20887/03, § 17, 18 January 2007). 13.

891,891,"The applicant, Ryszard Maciejewski, is a Polish national, born in 1949 and living in Leszno Górne, Poland. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 3 September 1993 the Agricultural Co-operative “N” lodged with the Słubice District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) an action in which it sought the dispossession of the applicant of a property situated in Kunowice. The property consisted of a detached house located on a plot of land. The first hearing was held on 17 September 1993 but it was adjourned as the plaintiff had submitted to the court a wrong address for the applicant and he had not been served with a summons. Between 19 October 1993 and 7 July 1994 the court adjourned three hearings because of the ill-health of the applicant and the presiding judge, and held seven hearings. The applicant failed to attend two of them. In the meantime, on 16 June 1994, the applicant asked the court to stay the case as he had initiated administrative proceedings concerning the contested property. On 25 August 1994 the Słubice District Court delivered a judgment in which it ordered the dispossession of the applicant. The court pointed out that on 18 August 1993 the applicant had moved into the house after it had been abandoned by a certain Mr A. Ł. However, the property belonged to the Co-operative, which had never agreed that the applicant should acquire its tenancy. On 14 November 1994 the applicant filed with the Gorzów Wielkopolski Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) an appeal against the judgment of the District Court. On 17 January 1995 the Gorzów Wielkopolski Regional Court quashed the judgment of 25 August 1994 and remitted the case to the Słubice District Court, instructing it to take additional evidence. The applicant was absent during the hearings held on 19 June and 7 September 1995. On the latter occasion his absence was caused by ill-health. The applicant was absent during the hearing held on 5 October 1995 because he refused to collect a summons. During the hearing held on 20 November 1995 the plaintiff changed its claim and asked the court to order the eviction of the applicant. It also requested the court to stay the case pending the outcome of the administrative proceedings instituted by the applicant, which request was granted. On 7 July 1999 the Słubice District Court decided to resume its examination of the case in view of the fact that the administrative proceedings and those concerning the title to the property, which the applicant had initiated on 10 September 1996, had been terminated. The applicant failed to attend the hearing held on 26 August 1999. On 23 September 1999 he sent to the court a letter which included the following statement: “The refusal to take part in the proceedings will prevent a scandal which the court intends to cause. The betrayal of their independence by the courts in Słubice and Gorzów Wielkopolski allowed me to apply to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, where I already await the examination of my complaint. Therefore I am returning the served summons.” On 28 September 1999 the Słubice District Court delivered a judgment ordering the eviction of the applicant. He failed to lodge an appeal against that decision in accordance with the relevant formalities.",0,553

The applicant and his wife frequently travelled between various European countries. On 16 April 1997, the Chief Constable of South Wales authorised the installation of covert recording devices at the applicant's cottage and this was carried out on 23 April 1997. Authority for a further 28 days' surveillance was granted on 14 May 1997. 9. Over 160 hours of tapes were obtained between the period of 25 April to 9 June 1997, on which latter date the applicant and his wife were arrested. The transcripts of the taped conversations made up the bulk of the case against the applicant. 10. At trial, the applicant's defence alleged that the recorded discussions, which occurred while he and the others concerned were under the influence of drugs, were “drug-crazed ramblings” and challenged their admissibility. A “voir dire” took place from 28 May to 1 June 1998, during which the defence made submissions concerning the procedure for authorisation of the surveillance and seeking inter alia to exclude irrelevant or prejudicial material under sections 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE). By agreement, the transcript evidence was reduced from five to two files and an agreed schedule was adopted by all counsel concerning the occasions on which the conversations occurred at the same time as drug taking. In summing up to the jury at the conclusion of the trial, the judge directed their attention to the fact that the supposedly incriminating statements taped at the cottage were or may have been the product of the participants' intoxicated state and that it was for them to assess whether despite the drugs the defendants were expressing rational, genuine thoughts, real ideas, plans or arrangements. 11. On 15 June 1998, the applicant was convicted of charges inter alia of conspiracy to import controlled drugs and possession of controlled drugs in connection with importation of marijuana and cocaine from overseas. He was sentenced to a total of fifteen years' imprisonment. A confiscation order was imposed on him on 24 September 1998 in the sum of 50,169.18 pounds sterling (GBP). 12. On 10 November 1999, a single judge of the Court of Appeal refused an extension of time to appeal against sentence and refused leave to appeal against conviction, noting that no satisfactory or sufficient reason had been given for the 11 month delay in lodging the application. The applicant's renewed application was refused by the Court of Appeal on 17 October 2000. 13. At the relevant time, the Home Office Guidelines of 1984 on the use of equipment in police surveillance operations provided that only chief constables or assistant chief constables were entitled to give authority for the use of such devices. The Guidelines were available in the library of the House of Commons and were disclosed by the Home Office on application. 14. In each case, the authorising officer had to satisfy himself that the following criteria were met: (a) the investigation concerned serious crime; (b) normal methods of investigation had been tried and failed, or had been, from the nature of things, unlikely to succeed if tried; c) there must have been good reason to think that the use of the equipment would be likely to lead to an arrest and a conviction, or where appropriate, to the prevention of acts of terrorism and d) the use of equipment was operationally feasible. 15. The 1997 Act provides a statutory basis for the authorisation of police surveillance operations involving interference with property or wireless telegraphy. The relevant sections relating to the authorisation of surveillance operations, including the procedures to be adopted in the authorisation process, entered into force on 22 February 1998. 16. Since 25 September 2000, these controls have been augmented by Part II of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (“RIPA”). In particular, covert surveillance in a police cell is now governed by sections 26(3) and 48(1) of RIPA. RIPA also establishes a statutory Investigatory Powers Tribunal to deal with complaints about intrusive surveillance and the use of informants by the police.",1,695
900,900,"8. On 15 April 1971 the Tirol Regional Government acting as the Agricultural Authority of First Instance (Landesregierung als Agrarbehörde 1.Instanz, “the Agricultural Authority”) received a motion dated 19 January 1971 for opening land consolidation proceedings at Kalkstein in the municipality of Innervillgraten, signed by the land owners concerned including the applicant. 9. On 3 May 1971 the Agricultural Authority ex officio opened the Kalkstein land consolidation proceedings (Zusammenlegungsverfahren), involving property in Innervillgraten of which the applicant and his siblings are co-owners. 10. On 28 May 1974 the Agricultural Authority held a hearing with the land owners concerned as regards the provisional transfer of land (vorläufige Übergabe). The majority of land owners accepted the authority’s proposal, whereas the applicant opposed it. At the close of the hearing the authority orally delivered the decision ordering the provisional transfer of land and informed the participants that no remedy was available against it under the Tirol Agricultural Land Planning Act 1969 (Flurverfassungs-Landesgesetz). 11. On 7 May 1979 the Agricultural Authority issued the consolidation scheme (Zusammenlegungsplan). 12. On 5 February 1981 the Provincial Board upon, inter alia, the applicant’s appeal, set aside the consolidation scheme on the ground that the Agricultural Authority had failed to carry out a proper valuation of the plots of land involved. Further, it declared that the area had to be cultivated as provided for in the provisional transfer of land of 28 May 1974 until a new consolidation scheme was issued. 13. On 14 September 1982 the Administrative Court (Verwaltungs-gerichshof), upon the complaint of the applicant and his co-owners, quashed the Provincial Board’s declaration that the consolidation area had to be cultivated as provided for in the provisional transfer until a new consolidation scheme was issued. It found that the Provincial Board had not been competent to make such a declaration. It was only called upon to decide on the merits of the case which had been before the Agricultural Authority, i.e. in the present case it had to decide on the lawfulness of the consolidation scheme. In any event, the decision on the provisional transfer of land had become final long ago. 14. After having held a hearing on 28 April 1983, the Agricultural Authority issued an occupation and valuation schedule (Besitzstandsausweis und Bewertungsplan). 15. On 1 December 1983 the Provincial Board dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It noted that the applicant had not contested the occupation schedule and had not submitted any arguments as regards the valuation of specific plots of land. There were no reasons to depart from the Agricultural Authority’s findings. 16. On 8 October 1984 the Constitutional Court (Verfassungs-gerichtshof) declined to deal with the applicant’s complaint and referred the case to the Administrative Court. 17. On 28 May 1985 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint, finding that he had not submitted any specific objections against the occupation and valuation schedule. 18. On 28 January 1990 the Agricultural Authority received further documents relating to a number of changes in the valuation of land. 19. On 17 May 1991 the Agricultural Authority issued a new consolidation scheme. It found, having regard to the valuation of the land, that the difference in value between the plots the applicant had owned prior to the proceedings and the plots allocated to him was less then the 5% which were admissible under the Agricultural Land Planning Act. For this difference it ordered payment of compensation. The consolidation scheme was open to public inspection at the Innervillgraten local authority during two weeks in July 1991. 20. The applicant did not appeal against the consolidation scheme which, following its publication, became final on 1 July 1991. However he appealed against the notification of 17 May 1991 by which the Agricultural Authority had informed the parties of the publication of the consolidation scheme. 21. On 29 October 1992 the Provincial Board rejected the applicant’s appeal as being inadmissible. It noted that the said appeal was directed against the notification of 17 May 1991, which was in itself not subject to appeal. 22. On 14 June 1993 the Constitutional Court declined to deal with the applicant’s complaint and referred the case to the Administrative Court. 23. On 24 October 1995 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. 24. By decision of 12 April 1996 the Agricultural Authority closed the consolidation proceedings following the entry of all changes of property in the land register in 1993 and the final settlement of the costs in early 1996. 25. On 21 June 1996 the Provincial Board dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 12 April 1996.",1,760
904,904,"5. The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Negotino. 6. On 22 November 2001 the public prosecutor requested an investigating judge of the Negotino Court of First Instance (“the trial court”) to open an investigation against the applicant on the count of forgery of a notice convening a meeting of shareholders of a company, N., in which he was also a shareholder (“the notice”). The applicant was accused of having deceived a considerable number of shareholders into signing the notice by misleading them in the belief that there would be only one item on the agenda, instead of eight, as was actually the case. The investigating judge heard the applicant and 47 witnesses. After the investigation had been completed, on 29 May 2002 the public prosecutor lodged an indictment against the applicant. 7. The trial court fixed twelve hearings, including that of 6 May 2004, which the applicant did not attend, although he had been summoned properly. During the trial, the court again heard oral evidence from the applicant, who had a court-appointed lawyer, and the 47 witnesses and admitted other documentary evidence. On 31 May 2005, in the presence of the applicant's lawyer only, the trial court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to four months' imprisonment suspended for one year. It did not rely on the statements made by the witnesses before the company's management denying that they had been informed about the remaining items on the agenda. The court rejected the applicant's defence as self-serving and the testimony of 6 defence witnesses as inconsistent and implausible. 8. On 13 July 2005 the applicant who, at the relevant time, was not represented by counsel, appealed against that decision. He did not request to be notified of the date of the session (седница) of the Court of Appeal. 9. On 2 November 2005 the Skopje Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal and upheld the trial court's decision. The court decided in private. The public prosecutor was present, but not the applicant. The court addressed the public prosecutor's written submission of 17 October 2005 and her oral pleadings requesting that the applicant's appeal be dismissed. 10. The decision was served on the applicant on 21 November 2005. 11. On 19 January 2006 the public prosecutor informed the applicant that there were no grounds for lodging a request with the Supreme Court for the protection of legality (“legality review request”). 12. Under section 361 (1) and (3) of the Criminal Proceedings Act (“the Act”) (Закон за кривична постапка), the chairman of the adjudicating panel of the Court of Appeal will appoint a judge rapporteur. The latter, in cases involving offences automatically subject to prosecution by the State, will forward the case file to the public prosecutor, who will examine and return it without delay. After receiving the case file, the chairman will fix a date for the session (седница) of the adjudicating panel. The public prosecutor will be notified thereof. 13. Section 362 (1) and (3) of the Act provides for notification of the date of session to be given, inter alia, to the defendant and his lawyer, the victim (as a plaintiff, тужител) and the private prosecutor (приватен тужител) if, within the period prescribed for the appeal or reply to the appeal, they so request or propose that a hearing (section 364 of the Act) be held before the second-instance court. Such notification may be given to parties who have not made such a request if their attendance would contribute to establishing the facts. The session starts with the presentation of a report prepared by a judge rapporteur. The panel may seek additional explanations from the parties attending the session. Parties can propose, with the aim of supplementing the report, that some documents from the case-file are read. They can also specify their arguments submitted in the appeal or reply to the appeal. 14. Section 364 (1) and (2) of the Act provides that the second-instance court will hold a hearing (претрес) only if new evidence needs to be produced or evidence re-produced, or if the case does not need to be remitted for fresh consideration. The defendant and his or her counsel, the public prosecutor, the victim and any witnesses or experts to be heard are summoned to attend the hearing before the second-instance court. 15. Under sections 403-410, the public prosecutor can submit a legality review request in respect of a final decision. The public prosecutor is always apprised of the session of the Supreme Court, which decides the legality review request. If the court accepts the legality review request submitted in favour of a person convicted, it cannot amend the final decision to his or her significant disadvantage in respect of the legal qualification of the crime and penalty imposed. If the legality review request is lodged against the person convicted, the court can only acknowledge the violation without amending the final decision.",1,819
905,905,"4. The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Lubiąż. 5. On 6 January 2006 the applicant was remanded in custody. The grounds for this decision are unknown, since the applicant has not produced a copy of the order. 6. On 7 November 2006 the Swiebodzin District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) extended the applicant’s detention. On the same day the court decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings against him. The court held that the applicant at the time of the commission of the offence had been incapable of recognising its significance or controlling his conduct because of his mental illness. The applicant had been diagnosed with schizophrenia (paranoid subtype). 7. On 1 October 2007 the applicant was placed in a mental hospital. 8. On 22 April 2008 the Świebodzin District Court decided to extend the applicant’s detention at the mental hospital. The court held that he was still suffering from severe schizophrenia. 9. On 22 July and 20 November 2008 the Świebodzin District Court decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the applicant due to his mental illness. The applicant’s state of health was confirmed by a medical certificate of 1 October 2008. 10. In the light of the applicant’s submissions, it is impossible to establish the facts relating to his detention. 11. On 4 December 2006 the Court received a letter from the applicant dated 23 November 2006. The letter was sent while the applicant was detained in the Szamotuły Remand Centre (Areszt Śledczy). It bears the following stamp: “District Court in Świebodzin, censored” (Sąd Rejonowy Świebodzin, Cenzurowano), a handwritten date: “28.11.06” and an illegible signature. 12. The relevant domestic law concerning censorship of detainees’ correspondence is set out in the Court’s judgment in the case of Kliza v. Poland, no. 8363/04, §§ 29-34, 6 September 2007.",1,298
912,912,"The applicant, Mr Machiel J. Polman, is a Netherlands national, who was born in 1958 and lives in Arnhem. He is represented before the Court by Mr J.H. Sassen, a lawyer practising in Arnhem. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 21 December 1995 the applicant’s ex-wife requested the Regional Court (arrondissementsrechtbank) of Arnhem to establish a maintenance arrangement (alimentatievoorziening) for herself and the two children born of their marriage. The Regional Court acceded to this request and ordered the applicant to pay monthly amounts of maintenance both to his children and his ex-wife. The applicant lodged an appeal with the Court of Appeal (gerechtshof) of Arnhem, which quashed the decision of the Regional Court and reduced the amount of the applicant’s maintenance obligations. As the applicant considered that the reasoning and calculations applied by the Court of Appeal were both incorrect and incomprehensible, he lodged an appeal on points of law (beroep in cassatie) with the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad). In his advisory opinion of 15 May 1998, one of the advocates-general (advocaten-generaal) of the Supreme Court recommended that the appeal be dismissed. A reply to this opinion was sent to the Supreme Court by counsel for the applicant on 28 May 1998. According to a stamp placed on the reply, it was received on the same day. The Supreme Court (civil-law division, Civiele Kamer) rejected the appeal on 4 September 1998. The decision (beschikking) stated that the applicant’s ex-wife had requested the Supreme Court to reject the appeal and that the advisory opinion of the advocate-general had also proposed that the appeal be dismissed. The decision did not mention that the applicant, or counsel on his behalf, had replied to that opinion or that account had been taken of that reply. In dismissing the appeal, the Supreme Court referred to Article 101a of the Judiciary (Organisation) Act (Wet op de Rechterlijke Organisatie) according to which the Supreme Court, if it considered that a complaint did not provide grounds for overturning the impugned decision and did not require answers to questions of law in the interests of the unity or development of the law, could, when giving reasons for its decision, limit itself to that finding. At the time relevant to the present case, Article 328 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering, “CCP”) provided that neither the parties nor their representatives were allowed to address the court after the public prosecution service had presented its opinion (Article 328 § 1 in conjunction with Article 326 CCP). However, pursuant to Article 328 § 2, simple notes (eenvoudige aantekeningen) contesting facts, which the parties believed had been presented incorrectly by the public prosecution service, could be submitted to the President of the court by the parties or their representatives. In a judgment of 28 March 1997, the Supreme Court held that it was free to take cognisance of comments submitted in response to the opinion issued by the public prosecution service by one of the parties unless this ran counter to the requirements of due process, seen also in the light of the interests of the other party (Nederlandse Jurisprudentie (NJ) 1997, no. 581). A similar reasoning was adopted by the Supreme Court in a judgment of 12 September 1997 (NJ 1998, no. 687), in which it held, with reference to the Court’s judgment in the case of Vermeulen v. Belgium (judgment of 20 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I), as follows: “... where Article 328 [of the Code of Civil Procedure] prevents parties from responding to the advisory opinion of the public prosecution service as they see fit, [this provision] should be deemed inapplicable as being incompatible with the provisions of Article 6 of the Convention, as interpreted in the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights (...). No restrictions other than those arising from due process, for instance in connection with the interests of the other party, apply to this document [i.e. the reply to the advisory opinion of the public prosecution service].” In order to observe the principle of due process, the Supreme Court allowed a period of two weeks for the submission of the response to the advisory opinion of the public prosecution service. On 1 January 2002 an amended Article 44 CCP entered into force, paragraph 3 of which gives parties the right to submit written comments in reply to the advisory opinion issued by the Procurator-General of the Supreme Court within two weeks of the transmission of the advisory opinion to them. At the time of the decision in the present case, September 1998, the general practice of the Supreme Court was to mention in its judgment or decision that a reply to the advisory opinion had been submitted. This was established as general practice in an internal decision (intern besluit) of the civil-law division of the Supreme Court of 25 June 1992, but the practice existed even before that time. The internal decision was not published.",0,840

On various dates, the applicants bought plots of land (nos. 1879 and 1878 respectively) near the coast in Hatay. The first applicant opened a wedding hall on the premises. The second applicant ran a cafeteria and a boarding house. 6. In 1995 the Samandağ Municipality, acting on behalf of the Treasury, requested the Samandağ Court of First Instance to determine whether the applicants’ plots of land were located within the coastline. A group of experts, composed of a geomorphologist, a cartography engineer and an agricultural engineer, appointed by the court, inspected the applicants’ land and concluded that they were located within the coastline. 7. Following the conclusions of the experts’ report, the Treasury filed two separate actions before the Samandağ Court of First Instance, requesting the annulment of the applicants’ title deeds to the lands on the ground that they were located within the coastline. 8. On 30 December 1999 and 24 December 1999 respectively, the Samandağ Court of First Instance, after having obtained additional experts’ reports, upheld the request of the Treasury and decided to annul the title deeds of the applicants to the plots of land. In its decisions, the court held that, pursuant to domestic law, coasts could not be subject to private ownership and that, therefore, the applicants could not rely on the argument that they had acted bona fides and on the fact that they had constructed buildings on the site. The Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants’ appeals on 10 July 2001 and 3 October 2000 respectively. 9. On various dates the applicants requested the Court of Cassation to rectify its decision submitting, inter alia, that the right to property was protected under international conventions, the constitution and the domestic law, and that the domestic courts had deprived them of their property rights without proper examination. The Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants’ requests on 17 January 2002 and 19 April 2001 respectively. These decisions were served on the applicants on 18 February 2002 and 24 May 2001 respectively. 10. The relevant domestic law and practice in force at the material time are outlined in the Doğrusöz and Aslan v. Turkey judgment (no. 1262/02, § 16, 30 May 2006).",0,380

The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant’s wife died on 14 February 1998. His claim for widows’ benefits was made on 28 February 2001 and was rejected on 1 March 2001 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows’ benefits because he was not a woman. On 6 March 2001 the applicant appealed and reconsideration took place on 8 March 2001 whereby the previous decision was upheld. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law. The applicant was not in receipt of child benefit at the time of his claim. The domestic law relevant to this application is set out in Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, §§ 1426, ECHR 2002-IV and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, §§ 40-41, 25 July 2007.",0,216

On 29 March 2000 and 9 January 2001 the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Kirov held for the applicant and awarded him compensation. It appears that both judgments became binding ten days after their pronouncement. The judgment of 29 March 2000 was not enforced, because the Ministry of Finance had lost the writ of enforcement. The judgment of 9 January 2001 was enforced on 5 June 2006. 7. Under section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997, a bailiff must enforce a judgment within two months.

(“the defendant”) under which the latter had agreed to produce and install some furniture in the applicant's house. The applicant made an advance payment. 6. On 12 April 1993 the applicant claimed annulment of the agreement since the defendant had not complied with it. 7. On 1 February 1994 the applicant specified his claim and sought compensation. 8. On 16 June 1995 the applicant lodged another compensation claim on a different ground. On the same date, the then Bitola Municipal Court (“the first-instance court”) ruled partly in favour of the applicant ordering a cross-cancellation of debts (пребивање). It made no decision in respect of the applicant's compensation claim since it had not been specified. On 26 March 1996 the Bitola Court of Appeal confirmed the decision on the merits and quashed it in respect of the trial costs. 9. After the defendant died, the first-instance court invited defendant's heirs (“the heirs”) to submit a court decision recognising them as his successors. 10. On 10 March 1997 the applicant successfully requested removal of the judge. 11. On 8 December 1998 the applicant further specified his claim. 12. After one hearing being adjourned due to the applicant's absence, the first-instance court dismissed the applicant's compensation claim on 19 January 2000. This decision was confirmed on the merits by the Bitola Court of Appeal's decision of 26 October 2000. On 10 April 2003 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant's appeal on points of law of 31 March 2001. This latter decision was served on the applicant on 25 August 2003. 13. The applicant's dismissal was annulled by a decision of the Bitola Court of Appeal of 16 October 1997. He was reinstated on 7 November 1997. 14. On an unspecified date in 1998, the applicant brought an action against his employer claiming compensation for the unlawful dismissal. 15. On 8 December 2000 the first-instance court ruled partly in his favour.

936,936,"The applicant, Mr Aleksandr Petrovich Sardin, is a Russian national, who was born in 1947 and lives in Omsk. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. Between May 1968 and September 1969 the applicant performed military service near the Semipalatinsk nuclear tests site. On 25 May 1998 the Ministry of Defence of Kazakhstan issued the applicant with a certificate confirming that he had been exposed to radioactive emissions during his military service. In 1998 and 1999 the applicant unsuccessfully applied to various Russian authorities to be granted the status of a victim of the Semipalatinsk nuclear tests. In October 1999 the applicant lodged a civil action against the Social Security Agency of the Omsk Regional Administration (“the Agency”). He challenged the refusal of the Agency to issue him with a certificate for citizens who had been exposed to radioactive emissions as a result of nuclear tests on the Semipalatinsk test site (“the Semipalatinsk certificate”). On 23 March 2000 the Tsentralniy District Court of Omsk granted the applicant’s action and ordered the Agency to provide him with the Semipalatinsk certificate confirming his entitlement to certain social benefits. The Agency did not appeal against the judgment and it became final on 3 April 2000. On 20 June 2000 the court bailiffs opened enforcement proceedings. The Agency did not execute the judgment and requested the Omsk Regional prosecutor’s office to bring an application for supervisory review. On 6 July 2000 the Omsk Regional prosecutor’s office ordered the court bailiffs to suspend the enforcement proceedings and lodged an application for supervisory review (протест в порядке надзора) with the Presidium of the Omsk Regional Court. The prosecutor submitted that the area where the applicant had served was not in the Russian list of areas that had suffered from radioactive emissions and the Kazakh legislation could not be applied by analogy. On 20 July 2000 the applicant received a court summons advising him that the hearing on the prosecutor’s complaint would take place on 1 August 2000. The applicant submits that on 25 July 2000 he filed written observations, but they were not accepted and he was promised that he would be given time to make oral submissions. On 1 August 2000 the Presidium of the Omsk Regional Court held a hearing. According to the applicant, his representatives were not given an opportunity to speak before the court and the written memorandum was only accepted by the court registrar after the hearing finished. The Presidium of the Omsk Regional Court, by way of supervisory review, quashed the judgment of 23 March 2000 on procedural and substantive grounds and remitted the case for a new examination. On 26 September 2000 the Tsentralniy District Court of Omsk made a new determination of the applicant’s action against the Agency and dismissed it as having no grounds in the domestic law. On 31 January 2001 the Civil Chamber of the Omsk Regional Court upheld, on the applicant’s appeal, the judgment of 26 September 2000. The Law “On the social protection of citizens who had been exposed to radioactive emissions as a result of nuclear tests on the Semipalatinsk test site” (no. 149-FZ of 19 August 1995), which was in force at the material time, provided that certain benefits and compensation available to the Chernobyl victims should be extended to those citizens who had lived in the area surrounding the Semipalatinsk test site and their descendants of the first and second generations. Articles 2 and 3 specified that the scope of the benefits and compensations should be determined by reference to a person’s exposure to radioactive emissions. These benefits and privileges included, in particular, free medical treatment, free medical insurance, housing maintenance subsidies, special payments to offset the loss of potential earnings, preferential treatment under labour laws, etc. Under Article 5 the Semipalatinsk certificates were the documents confirming a person’s entitlement to benefits and compensations set out in the Law.",0,657
937,937,"8. The only outstanding matter to be settled is the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) in the present case. Accordingly, as regards the facts, the Court will confine itself here to giving some brief particulars; for the remaining details, reference should be made to paragraphs 15 to 81 of the Court’s judgment of 28 June 1978 (ibid., pp. 7-27). 9. That judgment concerned the length of actions brought by Dr. König before the Frankfurt Administrative Court in 1967 and in 1971 to challenge, respectively, the withdrawal of the permit to run his clinic and the withdrawal of the authorisation to practise medicine. In the second matter, the Administrative Court had dismissed the applicant’s action by a judgment delivered on 9 June 1976 which had been affirmed by the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal on 2 May 1978. Dr. König lodged an appeal (Nichtzulässigkeitsbeschwerde) and an application to quash (Revision) but these were rejected by the Federal Administrative Court (Bundesverwaltungsgericht), in two final decisions, on 10 September and 18 October 1979. In the case concerning the clinic, the Frankfurt Administrative Court had dismissed Dr. König’s action on 22 June 1977. An appeal by him against that decision is still pending before the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal which, with the agreement of the parties, stayed the proceedings on 21 February 1979 pending the outcome of the above-mentioned proceedings before the Federal Administrative Court. 10. After delivery of the Court’s judgment of 28 June 1978, the Government and the applicant attempted, with the Commission’s assistance, to arrive at a friendly settlement of the latter’s claims, details whereof had been given by Mr. Hofferbert in his letter of 18 September 1978 (see paragraph 3 above). The attempt met with failure in November 1978: Dr. König found that the Government’s offer of DM 20,000 in full and final settlement was not sufficient. 11. The applicant seeks pecuniary compensation for the two heads of damage allegedly caused to him by the violation of Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1): he maintains that his financial and professional situation may have been permanently ruined and, secondly, that his personal and professional reputation had been indirectly lowered. Without quantifying his claims, he furnishes certain particulars – regarding notably the average annual income he could have anticipated as a medical practitioner and as the head of a clinic - on the basis of which he considers it possible to gauge the extent of his aggregate loss and to assess the fraction thereof attributable to the fact that the ""reasonable time"" was exceeded. In addition, the applicant asks for reimbursement of the expenses he incurred both in Germany, in order to expedite the hearing of his actions, and before the Convention institutions. Dr. König leaves the assessment of the sum to be awarded to him to the Court’s discretion, thereby confirming the position he had adopted in 1977 (Series A no. 27, p. 41, par. 113). 12. In their observations of 6 October 1978 (see paragraph 3 above), the Commission’s Delegates stated that they did not wish to comment on the first of the applicant’s claims which they saw as being concerned with the consequences of the two withdrawals of authorisation; at the hearing, they submitted that in their opinion the attribution of specific material losses to the breach found by the Court was impossible, at least on the strength of the evidence before it. On the other hand, the Delegates suggest that account should be taken of the fact that the applicant was left in a prolonged state of uncertainty as to his professional future, and this at a time of life - between the ages of forty-nine (in 1967) and sixty (in 1978) - when a man is normally at the peak of his career. They also consider that the breach of Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1), taken by itself, may be another factor having a bearing on an award of just satisfaction. As far as concerns the costs of the proceedings, the expenditure incurred by Dr. König in order to expedite the domestic litigation and to present his case in Strasbourg is regarded by the Delegates as a relevant item. They express no firm view as to whether the same applies to the expenditure arising from his applications to the German courts for restoration of the suspensive effect of his appeal against the withdrawal of the authorisation to practise; in their opinion, those applications were aimed not at speeding up the proceedings but at limiting the consequences of their excessive length. Neither do the Delegates comment on the justification for the figures given by the applicant. 13. The Government’s position is as follows: there is no causal link between the breach found by the Court and the alleged damage to Dr. König’s professional career; on the other hand, ""reasonable"", ""necessary"" and proven costs resulting from the exercise of the domestic legal remedies can give rise to compensation to the extent that those remedies were aimed at accelerating the procedure; furthermore, the ""reasonable costs"" incurred in connection with the proceedings before the Convention institutions should be reimbursed; finally, it is for the Court to determine whether the applicant should be awarded monetary compensation for the ""non-material"" injury he suffered by reason of the mere fact that the ""reasonable time"" was exceeded.",0,888
938,938,"The applicants, Mr Latif Guliyev and Cerulla Ramazanov, are Azerbaijani nationals who, respectively, were born in 1947 and 1951 and live in Baku and Sumgayit. They were represented before the Court by Ms L. Claridge and Messrs M. Muller, T. Otty and K. Yildiz of the Kurdish Human Rights Project, lawyers practising in London. The respondent Government was represented by Mr C. Asgarov, Agent of the Republic of Azerbaijan before the Court. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicants were members of the Adalet (“Ədalət”) political party, which was in opposition to the ruling party. As it appears from the case file, at the time of the events in question, the applicants’ party was not registered with the Ministry of Justice and, therefore, its activity was deemed illegal by the authorities. The party had a regional office in Sumgayit. According to the applicants, on 30 August 2001 some people related to the authorities removed from the office’s entrance door the signboard featuring the party’s name. On 10 September 2001 several police officers allegedly arrived in the office, destroyed some of the assets in the premises, forcefully expelled the party members from the premises and sealed up the office door. On 19 September 2001 the police again unexpectedly arrived in the party’s office in Sumgayit and interfered with the meeting which was held there at that time. The police explained that they had been called by persons in the neighbourhood complaining of the disturbance and noise coming from the office. The meeting participants objected to such interference. Following a dispute between the policemen and the meeting participants, the police took ten men to the police station for search and interrogation. After a few hours of being held at the police station, all arrested were released except for the applicants and one other person. On 22 September 2001 the investigation department of the Sumgayit City Police Station instituted criminal proceedings against the applicants and issued a bill of indictment, accusing the applicants of resistance to the police and violation of public order. On 23 September 2001 the Sumgayit City Court ordered the applicants’ detention on remand for one month pending trial. On 28 September 2001 the Court of Appeal upheld the detention order. On 24 December 2001 the Sumgayit City Court convicted the applicants for hooliganism, including the breaking of the public order, assault and resistance to the police authorities. According to the applicants, although a number of witnesses had testified in their favour, the court relied only on testimonies of seven police officers, all of whom testified against the applicants. The court sentenced each applicant to a one year and six months’ term of imprisonment. The applicants appealed against this judgment, complaining that the case had been fabricated, that the first-instance court had violated a number of procedural rules, and that it had failed to give legal assessment to the testimonies of the defence witnesses. On 13 February 2002 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicants’ request and upheld the district court’s judgment. The Court of Appeal found that the applicants’ guilt was sufficiently proven by the witness testimonies admitted by the first-d the applicants’ imprisonment sentence to a conditional sentence. The applicants were therefore released. The applicants lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court, seeking acquittal. On 9 July 2002 the Supreme Court dismissed their appeal and upheld the lower courts’ judgments. Thereafter, based on a request by the President of the Supreme Court, the proceedings were reopened and the case was referred to the Plenum of the Supreme Court. On 27 January 2005 the Plenum quashed the Supreme Court’s decision of 9 July 2002 and the related judgment of the Court of Appeal of 13 February 2002 On 17 March 2005, the Court of Appeal re-examined the case. It reassessed the evidence and found that there had not been any significant inconsistencies in witness testimonies admitted by the first-instance court. As to the testimonies of witnesses in the applicants’ favour, the Court of Appeal noted that these witnesses were members of the applicants’ political party and that, therefore, their testimonies were not trustworthy and were in any event refuted by the totality of evidence. The Court of Appeal confirmed the applicants’ conviction and their conditional sentence of one year and six months. It also noted in its judgment that it was open to the applicants to file a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court in accordance with the domestic criminal procedure law. The applicants did not, however, make use of this possibility. According to Article 408.1.1, a cassation appeal or cassation protest may be filed against judgments of appellate-instance courts. Article 409.1 provides that, inter alia, convicted persons shall have a right to file a cassation appeal themselves or through their legal representative. According to Article 410, depending on the substance of the complaints made before the cassation-instance court, the time-limit for lodging of the cassation appeal may constitute up to 18 months from the date of delivery of the appellate-instance court’s judgment. Article 412 provides that the cassation appeal must be submitted, in writing, directly to the cassation-instance court. In accordance with Article 416, the cassation-instance court may quash or amend the appellate-instance court’s judgment, if, inter alia, the latter has refused without justification to examine important evidence presented by a party to the case, breached the procedural rules for assessment of the evidence, delivered a verdict based on inadmissible evidence, and made a mistake in qualification of the crime.",0,923
945,945,"The applicant is a Turkish national, born in 1969, and, at the time of the introduction of the application, was detained in the Netherlands. He is represented before the Court by Mr G.P. Hamer, a lawyer practising in Amsterdam.  On 17 February 1993, the applicant, an employee of the Netherlands Railway Company, was arrested and taken into detention on suspicion of embezzlement and of having been involved in a robbery committed on 24 October 1992 at the Amsterdam Central Station. On 12 May 1993, following the applicant’s appeal against a decision of 25 March 1993 prolonging his pre-trail detention, the Court of Appeal (Gerechtshof) of Amsterdam ordered the applicant’s release from pre-trial detention. After an initial summons had been withdrawn, the applicant was summoned to appear on 15 December 1993 before the Regional Court (Arrondissementsrechtbank) of Amsterdam. The judges dealing with his case would be Ms O. as President, and Ms P. and Mr B. On 25 November 1993, the applicant filed an objection (bezwaar) against the summons. On 15 December 1993, after having deliberated, the Regional Court sitting in chambers (Arrondissementsrechtbank in Raadkamer), composed of Ms O., Ms P. and Mr B., rejected the objection. Subsequently and on the same day, the Regional Court commenced its examination of the charges brought against the applicant. As the composition of the Regional Court was the same as that of the Regional Court sitting in chambers that had rejected the objection against the summons, the defence challenged (wraking) the three judges. After having deliberated, three other judges of the Regional Court rejected the challenge. The Regional Court, in its original composition, then resumed its examination of the applicant’s case. In the course of 15 December 1993, the Regional Court took a short break in order to hand down its judgment in the criminal proceedings that had been brought against the coaccused R.M. Sitting in the same composition as in the applicant’s case, the Regional Court convicted R.M. of the robbery committed on 24 October 1992. After having become aware of this, the applicant challenged the Regional Court for a second time when later that day the court resumed its examination of his case. After having deliberated, three other judges of the Regional Court rejected the challenge. The Regional Court, in its initial composition, resumed its examination. It considered a request of the defence to take evidence from eleven witnesses, ordered that evidence should be taken from four of them and adjourned its further examination. On 9 March 1994, the Regional Court heard evidence from the four witnesses whose appearance it had ordered on 15 December 1993 and heard the parties’ final pleadings. In its judgment of 23 March 1994, the Regional Court convicted the applicant of robbery committed on 24 October 1992 at the Amsterdam Central Station, and participation in the commission of unlawful deprivation of liberty and embezzlement. The applicant filed an appeal with the Court of Appeal (Gerechtshof) of Amsterdam. On 13 July 1994, the Court of Appeal started its examination of the applicant’s appeal. Further hearings were held on 9 November 1994 and 21 December 1995, in the course of which the Court of Appeal, inter alia, heard a number of witnesses. In its judgment of 4 January 1996, the Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of 23 March 1994. On the basis of the full rehearing on both facts and law that had taken place before it, the Court of Appeal convicted the applicant of participation in a robbery and embezzlement, acquitted him of the remaining charges and sentenced him to four years’ imprisonment. It rejected the argument advanced by the defence that, given the composition of the Regional Court, the case should be referred back to the Regional Court as the Regional Court that had convicted the applicant could not be considered as an impartial tribunal in that the same judges had rejected the applicant’s objection against the summons and had already formed a view on the matter in that they had already convicted a co-accused. The applicant filed an appeal in cassation with the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad). By judgment of 6 May 1997, the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s appeal in cassation. It rejected the applicant’s arguments in relation to the alleged partiality of the Regional Court.",0,712
947,947,"5. The applicant was born in 1978 and lives in Kaunas. 6. The applicant owned a flat together with another person, I.B. On 15 May 2001 the applicant and I.B. disconnected the flat from the central heating system provided by the company “Litesko Ltd.” (hereinafter – Litesko), and signed a contract with an alternative heating provider. On 15 June 2001 the new provider’s heating system was installed in the flat. On 6 August and repeatedly on 17 October 2001 the applicant informed Litesko about the termination of their old agreement. According to the applicant, in the following months they received no bills from the old heating provider. In February 2002, however, Litesko sent a bill for heating to the applicant and I.B. 7. Following the refusal by the applicant to pay the bill, Litesko filed a civil claim for payment for the period from 1 January 2002 to 1 September 2003. 8. On 7 June 2004 the Palanga City District Court (hereinafter - the Palanga Court) dismissed the claim by Litesko. The court observed that the owners of the flat were free to choose their heating provider and they had informed the plaintiff about the termination of the agreement and properly disconnected from the heating system. The court concluded that the plaintiff itself had acknowledged that it no longer supplied heating to the flat. It was also established that the applicant together with I.B. and Litesko were no longer in a contractual relationship for heat consumption. The Palanga Court noted that the claim filed by the plaintiff was an unsubstantiated attempt to enrich itself at the expense of the other party. 9. Litesko missed the time-limit for lodging an appeal and its request to renew it was dismissed. Neither of the parties requested re-opening of the proceedings. 10. In 2006 Litesko brought a new claim against the applicant and I.B., requesting payment for heating for the period 1 April 2004 to 1 September 2005. 11. On 20 March 2006 the Kaunas City District Court upheld the claim and awarded Litesko 490 Lithuanian litai (LTL; approximately 142 euros (EUR)) against each of the owners. Having re-interpreted the domestic law, the court ruled that the applicant and I.B. were still in a contractual relationship with Litesko because they had arbitrarily disconnected the heating system and thus they had to pay for the heating. The court found that the 7 June 2004 court decision did not have res judicata effect as the new claim concerned a different period of time, and that this situation was therefore not identical to the one ruled upon earlier by another District Court. 12. On 20 June 2006 the Kaunas Regional Courta contractual relationship between the parties and the supply of heating to the flat. 13. The applicant did not have the right to lodge a cassation appeal as the amount of the claim was smaller than the minimum required by domestic law for the lodging of such an appeal. 14. Article 279 § 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that once a judgment, decision or ruling becomes effective, the parties or other persons to the proceedings as well as the successors to their rights may not raise once again the same claims on the same grounds, and may not contest the facts and legal relations that had been established by a court in another case.",1,560
949,949,"9. The applicants, Volkan Ükünç and Deniz Güneş, are Turkish nationals. They were both born in 1980 and live in Edirne, Turkey. 10. On 8 February 1996 the applicants were taken into custody by the Edirne Anti-Terror Branch on suspicion of being members of an illegal organisation, namely, the DHKP-C (Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front). The applicants were kept in custody until 12 February 1996. They were interrogated by the police on 10 February 1996 in the absence of their lawyers. 11. On 12 February 1996 the applicants were brought before the Public Prosecutor and then before a judge. On both occasions they repeated their statements of 10 February 1996. The applicants were released on the same day. They were not represented by lawyers. 12. On 11 March 1996 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed an indictment with the court and accused the applicants and three other co-accused of aiding and abetting an illegal terrorist organisation and requested the court to apply Article 169 of the Turkish Criminal Code and section 5 of Law No. 3713 (the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 as amended). 13. On 17 April 1996 the Edirne Assize Court requested the applicants' observations on the charges against them for submission to the Istanbul State Security Court. According to the minutes of the hearing which took place before the Edirne Assize Court, the applicants did not want to be represented by lawyers. They challenged for the first time the authenticity of the statements which they gave to the police, to the public prosecutor and to the judge. 14. On 21 May 1996 the applicants requested the Istanbul State Security Court not to require them to appear at any of the hearings since they had to attend school. This request was upheld by the court and the applicants were legally represented by four lawyers in their absence in subsequent hearings. 15. On 8 April 1997 the Istanbul State Security Court found the applicants guilty of aiding and abetting the DHKP-C, and sentenced them to two years and six months' imprisonment. The court pointed out that the applicants' defence statement to the Edirne Assize Court alleging that they had been forced to repeat the prepared confession statements when brought before the public prosecutor and the judge on 12 February 1996 was unconvincing. The court concluded that the applicants aided and abetted the DHKP-C by painting a slogan on a wall, distributing publications supporting DHKP-C and putting up a placard in the entrance of a shop. 16. The applicants appealed on the ground that they were convicted on the basis of the statements they had given under duress and that there was, therefore, no concrete evidence on which they could be convicted. 17. On 9 December 1997 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal lodged by the applicants and upheld the State Security Court's decision. The Cassation Court noted in its decision that the applicants' lawyers, despite having requested the Cassation Court to hold an appeal hearing, did not attend the hearing. 18. In accordance with established practice, the judgment of the Court of Cassation of 9 December 1997 was sent to the Istanbul State Security Court and deposited with that court's Registry on 5 January 1998. 19. The applicants claim that they became aware of the decision on 4 March 1998. 20. On 9 March 1998 the applicants applied for rectification of the Court of Cassation's decision on the ground that the preliminary investigation was unlawful having been conducted without their lawyer being present and given that they were minors at the date of the offences. The applicants' rectification request was rejected on 22 May 1998. 21. The Court refers to the overview of the domestic law derived from previous submissions in other cases, in particular Özel v. Turkey (no. 42739/98, §§ 20-21, 7 November 2002) and Gençel v. Turkey (no. 53431/99, §§ 11-12, 23 October 2003).",1,651
950,950,"4. The applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Ankara. 5. On an unspecified date in 1990 the General Directorate of National Roads and Highways expropriated a plot of land belonging to the applicant in Ankara in order to build the Ankara Central Motorway. The authorities paid him the value of the land, assessed by a committee of experts, when the expropriation took place. 6. Following the applicant’s request, on 27 June 1995 the Ankara Civil Court awarded him additional compensation plus interest at the statutory rate applicable. 7. On 18 March 1996 the Court of Cassation upheld that judgment. 8. On 18 February 1998 the amount of 4,560,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL) was paid to the applicant. 9. The relevant domestic law and practice are set out in the case of Akkuş v. Turkey (judgment of 9 July 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997IV, §§ 13-16).",0,148
953,953,"The applicant, Mr Mubariz Yagubov, is an Azerbaijani national who lives in Tovuz, Azerbaijan. He is represented before the Court by Mr B. Hajiyev, a lawyer practising in Baku. The Azerbaijani Government (“the Government”) are represented by their Agent, Mr Ç. Asgarov. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant was involved in a property dispute with a private person (S.) over a retail shop located in the Govlar settlement of the Tovuz Region. At the time of the dispute, the shop was in S.’s possession. The applicant claimed to have bought the shop from its previous owners, who had privatised it in 2003, while S. argued that the privatisation process had been unlawful and that he had a lawful claim to the shop. The applicant lodged a lawsuit seeking S.’s eviction from the shop. By a judgment of 23 November 2005, the Shamkir District Court found that the applicant had purchased the shop on 6 October 2003 and was its lawful owner pursuant to the ownership certificate issued by the Ministry of Economic Development on 16 January 2004. The court further found that S. had unlawfully occupied the shop without the owner’s permission. Accordingly, the court ordered S. to vacate the shop. S. appealed against that judgment. On 7 April 2006 the Court of Appeal delivered a judgment dismissing S.’s appeal. The Shamkir District Court’s judgment of 23 November 2005 thus became final immediately. No further appeals were filed. According to information submitted by the Government, on 2 May 2006 the Tovuz Department of Enforcement Officers enforced the judgment of 23 November 2005 as upheld by the Court of Appeal and S. was evicted from the shop by the police. By a decision of 4 May 2006, the Tovuz District Court terminated the enforcement proceedings as the judgment of 23 November 2005 had been executed. It appears from the case file that the same shop was subsequently occupied by three other persons. On 26 September 2007 the Tovuz District Court delivered a judgment ordering their eviction from the shop. That judgment was enforced on 15 February 2008. According to the applicant, however, the shop was subsequently occupied again, by other persons related to S.",0,374
954,954,"6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 7. The applicants joined together to form the “True Orthodox Church in Moldova” (“the Church”) and applied for registration by the Government on the basis of the Religious Denominations Act (Law no. 979-XII of 24 March 1992). When the authorities refused to register the Church by letter of 29 November 2000, the applicants initiated court proceedings. 8. On 30 August 2001 the Court of Appeal accepted their claim and ordered the Government to register the Church. The court also awarded each of the applicants 1,000 Moldovan lei (approximately 85 euros (EUR) at the time) in compensation for the non-pecuniary damage suffered. 9. On 29 May 2002 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld that judgment, finding that the Government had not submitted any evidence that the Church would harm public order, health or morals. That judgment was final and enforceable. 10. The applicants subsequently made requests for the enforcement of the final judgment. In turn, the Judgments Enforcement Department made requests to the Government to comply with the judgment, to no avail. 11. On 12 July 2002 the Religious Denominations Act was amended and the procedure for the registration of religious denominations was simplified. On the basis of these amendments, on 7 August 2002 the applicants asked the “State Organ for the Protection of Religious Denominations” to register the Church. They relied on Article 14 of the above-mentioned law (as amended on 12 July 2002, see below) and on the final judgment in their favour ordering the Church’s registration. 12. By letter of 23 August 2002 the State Service for the Protection of Religious Denominations (“the Service”) rejected that request because it “had not received any request for the registration of any religious denomination”. The Service could not register the Church until the relevant State Registry had been established and the necessary documents had been filed with it. On 22 November 2002 the applicants submitted the relevant documents to the Service. 13. On 24 August 2004 the Decisions Enforcement Department (“the Department”) sent the enforcement warrant for enforcement to the Service. By its letters of 1 and 11 November 2002 and 14 March 2003 the Department requested the Service to comply with the judgment of 30 August 2001. 14. In a letter of 14 March 2003 the Service replied to the Department that the applicants had refused to re-submit documents requested from them and to explain certain parts of the statute of the Church regarding its canonical subordination to foreign churches. 15. On 20 March 2003 an officer working for the Department found that the judgment of 30 August 2001 had not been enforced and asked the court to sanction those responsible for the non-enforcement. The officer sent additional requests to the Department and the Buiucani District Court on 16 May, 18 June, 24 October and 6 November 2003, again asking that those responsible for the non-enforcement be punished. 16. The Government made three attempts to re-open the proceedings by claiming the discovery of new and relevant information which had not been previously known. These requests were rejected by decisions of the Court of Appeal on 7 May 2003 and the Supreme Court of Justice on 1 October 2003 and 20 October 2004. 17. In June 2004 the applicants submitted a new request and a set of accompanying documents, requesting the registration of the Church. They received no reply. 18. The pecuniary part of the judgment of 30 August 2001 was enforced on 27 July 2005. 19. The relevant domestic law has been set out in the cases of Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Others v. Moldova (no. 45701/99, §§ 89-93, ECHR 2001XII) and Prodan v. Moldova (no. 49806/99, § 31, ECHR 2004III (extracts)). 20. In addition, the relevant provisions of the Law for the amendment of the Religious Denominations Act (no.1220, 12 July 2002) read as follows: “Article I 3. Article 14 shall have the following text: ‘Article 14. Recognition of cults. In order to be able to organise themselves and to function, a religious denomination shall submit to the State authority [dealing with] religious denominations a declaration on their functioning and organisation, annexing their statute (by-laws) for their organisation and functioning including information about the system of administration and functioning, together with the fundamental principles of its faith. The declaration mentioned [above] shall be submitted to the State authority for religious denominations, which shall make a registration in the Registry of religious denominations within 30 working days from the date of submission of the declaration.’ ... Article III (2) Requests for registration which were pending at the date of entry into force of the present Law shall be considered to be declarations within the meaning of Article 14 of the Law on Religious Denominations and shall be examined in accordance with the provisions of that Article.”",1,813

On 7 September 2006 the applicants announced a collective two-day hunger strike in protest against the conditions of detention of Abdullah Öcalan, leader of the PKK (the Workers’ Party of Kurdistan), an illegal, armed organisation. On 11 September 2006 the Diyarbakır F-type Prison Disciplinary Board imposed a disciplinary sanction on the applicants, consisting of a one-month ban on sports activities and conversation in groups (spor ve sohbet etkinlikleri), for launching a hunger strike and forming a group with a view to breaching the regulations. The applicants lodged appeals, which were rejected by the Diyarbakır Enforcement Court and the Diyarbakır Assize Court on 25 September and 9 October 2006 respectively. The final decision was deposited with the registry of the court on 10 November 2006. Law no. 5275 on the Enforcement of Sentences and Preventive Measures provides as follows: Article 40 “1.

The applicant is a retired military serviceman. “... the military commissioner is to reinstate Belayev in the list of military personnel and to eliminate the violations of the procedure of his discharge from work... and then [again] exclude Belayev from the list of military personnel, after having provided him with all kinds of military provisions, including monetary ones...” On 12 January 2004 the Military Commissioner replied to the applicant stating that in 1990 he had been provided with a flat in Magadan, that in 1997 his wife had privatised the flat and that in 1999 she had sold it. The letter further stated: “... Thus, you have forfeited your entitlement to be provided with housing by the State or by the Ministry of Defence...” On 27 March 2004 the applicant brought proceedings against the Military Commissioner at the Garrison Court. On 2 June 2004 the Garrison Court refused to examine the applicant’s complaint stating that the same complaint had been already examined by the court’s decision of 15 November 2001. The applicant appealed against this decision to the court of the North-Caucasus Military Circuit Court (the Circuit Court). On 13 October 2004 the Circuit Court overruled this decision and returned the case for a fresh examination. On 21 October 2004 the Garrison Court rejected the applicant’s complaint. The court referred to the Military Commissioner’s letter of 12 January 2004 and stated that the applicant had missed the three-month statutory time-limit for the appeal against actions of officials. The text of the court’s decision stated, inter alia, the following: “... During the hearing the applicant stated that he did not miss the three-month time-limit for appeal of actions of officials, as he had received the Military Commissioner’s written refusal ... on 12 January 2004 and that he had lodged his complaint with the court on 27 March 2004... The court finds that the applicant’s reference [to the above dates] is unsubstantiated for the following reasons: ... according to Article 239 of the former Civil Procedure Code and Article 256 of the acting Civil Procedure Code, a citizen must lodge his complaint within three months from the date when he learnt about a violation of his rights [by a State official]. The Court finds that it is obvious that after the sale of his flat in Magadan on 18 February 1999 the applicant was aware of the absence of housing for him and his family. Further, by the Military Commissioner’s order no. 161 issued on 27 December 1999 the applicant was excluded from the list of the military personnel. Being aware of the exclusion from the list, the applicant appealed this order in June 2001 to the Garrison Court. In these circumstances, the court finds that the applicant was aware of the exclusion from the list of military personnel [and of the relevant entitlements] ...and the violation of his rights by the State official in June 2001... ...The applicant’s [current] complaint was received by the Garrison Court on 17 May 2004. In this situation the Court finds that the three-month time limit for appeal against the actions of the Military Commissioner ... was missed by the applicant. As to the applicant’s reference that the time limit started running over again after ... in January 2004 he had received the written refusal of the State official, the court finds it unconvincing as the time limit [for the appeal against actions of officials] should be calculated from the earliest event...” The applicant appealed this decision to the Circuit Court. On 16 February 2005 the Circuit Court upheld the decision of the Garrison Court and it became final. Article 256 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in force as of 1 February 2003 stipulates: “Limitation period for judicial complaints: 1. A citizen has the right to apply to a court within the period of three months starting from the day when he leant about the violation of his rights [by a State official].”",0,680
961,961,"4. The applicant was born in 1977 in Sivas. 5. On 6 May 1998 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of being a member of an illegal organisation. 6. On 9 May 1998 he was brought before the public prosecutor and investigating judge at the Istanbul State Security Court, who ordered his pre-trial detention. 7. On 11 May 1998 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicant, charging him with membership of an illegal organisation. 8. On 14 July 1998 due to the factual and legal connection between the cases, the court decided to joint the applicant’s case to other proceedings, involving seven accused (no. 1998/2). 9. On the same day the applicant was released pending trial. 10. On 29 July 2000 a change took place in the judges sitting as a bench at the Istanbul State Security Court and therefore, the next hearing was scheduled on 7 September 2000. 11. On 16 November 2000 the hearing was postponed to 20 February 2001 due the change in the assignment of judges at the trial court. 12. On 20 February 2001 the applicant was summoned to appear before the court in order to make his supplementary submissions for his defence, in view of a possible alteration of the offence he was charged with. 13. On 10 May 2001 the court observed that the registered writ having sent to the applicant, returned to the case file without a delivery. 14. On 30 November 2001 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed an additional bill of indictment, charging the applicant with using explosives. 15. From the date of 10 May 2001 to 24 May 2007, despite the authorities’ efforts to have summoned the applicant, his whereabouts could not be established. During that period, the court ordered the Avcılar Police Department to make an enquiry to the applicant’s family about his nonappearance. Subsequently, the court was informed that the applicant had gone abroad to study. 16. The trial court invited the prosecutor’s office to transmit the arrest warrant against the applicant to the customs with a view to securing his appearance before the court once he entered the country. 17. Following a constitutional amendment, State Security Courts were abolished and the applicant’s case was transferred to the Istanbul Assize Court. 18. On 6 November 2007, in his defence submissions to the court, the applicant’s lawyer claimed that the applicant had already been tried by another chamber of the Istanbul Assize Court on the basis of the same facts and requested that the matter be examined further. 19. On 3 April 2008 the Istanbul Assize Court ordered the case file of the proceedings in question to verify the reason for the applicant’s previous conviction. 20. On 24 February 2009 the court ruled that the criminal proceedings be discontinued on the ground that the prosecution was time-barred. On the same day, the applicant’s lawyer lodged an appeal against the judgment. 21. According to the submissions in the case file, the proceedings are currently pending before the Court of Cassation.",1,518
962,962,"The applicant, Mr Talip Köklü, is a Turkish national who was born in 1940 and lives in Ordu. He is represented before the Court by Mr Vural Soytekin, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 3 September 1996 the applicant applied to the Giresun Forestry Management Directorate in order to cut 1/3 of the trees on his land. On 26 May 1997 the administration rejected his application on the ground that this part of the land was classified as forestland, therefore cutting of the trees therein was prohibited pursuant to the relevant legislation. On 27 May 1997 the applicant brought an action before the Trabzon Administrative Court to annul the administration’s decision. On 9 June 1997 the court notified the applicant’s lawyer in writing that the court charges have not been paid. On 6 October 1997 the court further notified the applicant’s lawyer that the adjudication of the case would be discontinued until the court’s receipt of the relevant charges pursuant to Article 6/4 of the Code on Administrative Procedures. On 12 November 1997 the applicant’s lawyer paid the court charges. On 17 June 1998 a new administrative court was established in Ordu to adjudicate on the legal claims in Ordu and Giresun provinces with a view to lightening the case-load of the Trabzon Administrative Court. On 3 July 1998 the case was transferred to the newly established Ordu Administrative Court which immediately started the proceedings by requesting the Ankara General Directorate of Forestry to submit their observations on the merits of the case. On 18 February 1999 the Ankara General Directorate of Forestry submitted their arguments on the merits of the case together with a report on the classification of the location of the applicant’s land supported by the relevant evidence. On 13 July 1999 the Ordu Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s claim for annulment of the administration’s decision. On 22 October 1999 the applicant appealed against this judgment before the Supreme Administrative Court. On 26 October 1999 the Supreme Administrative Court notified the applicant’s lawyer that the court charges had not been paid and informed him that the adjudication of the case would be discontinued until the court’s receipt of such payment. On 9 November 1999 the applicant’s lawyer paid the said charges. On 8 November 2001 the Supreme Administrative Court rejected his appeal against the administrative court’s judgment. On 3 December 2001 the administrative court’s judgment was communicated to the applicant.",0,418
971,971,"The applicant, Mr Thomas Eule, is a German national who was born in 1943 and lives in München. The applicant is a retired military officer who underwent psychotherapeutic and psychoanalytical treatment from 1987 onwards. He was discharged in 1988 on grounds of his medical condition. The therapy was discontinued in March 1991 in view of the applicant having fallen in love with the therapist, who initially treated the applicant's feelings as “transference of affection” (Übertragungsliebe) and personally sought supervision. In October 1991 the applicant and the therapist commenced an intimate relationship that ended in May 1992. On 5 June 1997 the applicant sued the therapist for damages of German marks 156,238.50 (DEM) (euros 79,883.48 (EUR)). He argued that the therapist had discontinued the therapy in view of the commencing of an intimate relationship and had thereby violated her duties from the contract governing the therapeutic treatment as well as her professional duty to remain sexually uninvolved with a client; because of the therapeutic malpractice he had suffered from a mental breakdown that had required further therapeutic treatment for which he had incurred the damage complained of. On 2 April 1998 the Munich Regional Court ordered a first expert opinion. The expert witness submitted that the therapist had seriously breached her professional duties. The court held that the expert opinion was not satisfactory as it was incoherent, not fully reasoned and did not differentiate between professional, therapeutic and ethical standards. In response to the opinion of the first expert witness, the defendant therapist submitted a private expert opinion that found no violation of therapeutic and professional standards and denied that the therapist's actions were causally linked to the damage complained of. The court noted that the private expert opinion had come to different conclusions from the first expert opinion but was not in itself fully satisfactory; the court therefore ordered another expert opinion on 17 August 1999. The second expert witness criticised the previous expert opinions for their reliance on psychoanalytical tools and denied any wrongdoing on the part of the therapist as she had conscientiously transferred the therapeutic relationship into an intimate one between consenting adults. The court noted that the second expert witness' opinion was unsatisfactory because the parties had engaged in – among other therapeutic techniques – psychoanalysis and the expert witness had displayed an overly critical and biased assessment of psychoanalysis. On 16 February 2001 the court ordered a third expert opinion pursuant to Article 412(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure (see “Relevant domestic law” below). The expert witness delivered his opinion on 10 December 2002; at the applicant's instigation, the expert witness submitted a clarification of his opinion on 9 April 2003. He stated no discernable professional standards for the gentle cancellation of a therapeutic relationship could be verified; there were no professional standards concerning the period between the discontinuation of a therapeutic and the beginning of an intimate relationship between therapist and patient; the only possible link between the intimate relationship and the damage complained of was the applicant's realisation that he had not found what he had been looking for. On 30 April 2003 the applicant challenged the third expert witness on grounds of bias; on 10 June 2003 the court rejected the challenge as ill-founded. On 9 July 2003 the court dismissed the applicant's claim at the end of an oral hearing. It held that the therapist had not violated therapeutic and professional standards and based its decision mainly on the third expert witness's opinion, which it held to be convincing, methodically sound and precise. On 12 November 2003 the Munich Court of Appeal informed the parties of its intention to dismiss an appeal lodged by the applicant as ill-founded pursuant to Article 522(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure (see “relevant domestic law” below) on the grounds that the first expert witness' opinion had been rightly rejected by the Regional Court. The Court of Appeal noted that the therapist had acted responsibly, had not violated the therapist's duty to remain sexually uninvolved and that there were no strict professional rules concerning the minimum period between the ending of a therapeutic and the beginning of an intimate relationship between a former therapist and patient. On 11 March 2004 counsel for the applicant submitted further observations. On 15 March 2004 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal. On 16 April 2004 counsel for the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court arguing that the Court of Appeal had not taken into account the applicant's further submissions of 11 March 2004 and had treated the applicant as a perpetrator rather than a victim of sexual abuse. On 4 October 2005 the Federal Constitutional Court, relying on the relevant provisions of its Rules of Procedure, refused to accept the applicant's constitutional complaint for examination without giving further reasons (no. 1 BvR 878/04). Under Article 412(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure the court may order a new expert opinion by the same or another expert witness if it considers the expert opinion to be unsatisfactory. Under Article 522(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Court of Appeal may reject an appeal by unanimous decision if it is convinced that the appeal has no prospect of success, the legal matter is not of fundamental importance and the development of the law or the safeguarding of consistent jurisprudence do not necessitate that a decision be given by the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal or its presiding judge have to inform the parties of their intention to reject the appeal and the reasons thereof and have to give the appellant the opportunity to submit observations within a set time-limit. The decision under Article 522(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure is not subject to an appeal and the Court of Appeal cannot grant leave to appeal on points of law.",0,979
977,977,"5. The applicant is a university professor of ancient history and archeology who was appointed at Klagenfurt University in 1998. Under the terms of appointment he was entitled to reimbursement of the removal costs and to a household allowance. In April 2001 the sum of 5,699.21 euros (EUR) was paid to the applicant. 6. On 6 July 2001 the applicant claimed reimbursement of the remaining removal costs in the sum of EUR 4,684.40 and payment of the household allowance in the sum of EUR 5,443.70, plus 4.5% interest since August 1999. 7. The Dean of Klagenfurt University dismissed the applicant’s claim on 16 January 2002. 8. The applicant appealed on 29 January 2002 to the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture (“the Ministry”). 9. The Ministry did not decide within the statutory six-month time-limit laid down in section 73 § 1 of the General Administrative Proceedings Act. In August 2002 the applicant brought court proceedings relating to the claims at issue. A conditional settlement was reached but was revoked by the applicant in January 2003. The applicant’s action was dismissed in February 2003. 10. Meanwhile, on 18 November 2002, the applicant complained to the Administrative Court under Article 132 of the Federal Constitution about the administration’s failure to determine his claim. On 29 November 2002 the Administrative Court ordered the Ministry of Education to issue a decision within three months. 11. On 3 March 2003 the Ministry dismissed the applicant’s appeal. 12. The applicant lodged a complaint with the Administrative Court on 16 April 2003. The Ministry filed observations in reply on 24 June 2003. 13. On 24 February 2006 the Administrative Court quashed the Ministry’s decision as being unlawful. 14. By decision of 25 July 2006 the Ministry referred the case back to the Dean of Klagenfurt University for a new decision. Meanwhile on 8 May 2006 the applicant supplemented his claims, apparently requesting reimbursement of costs incurred for travelling between Klagenfurt and his former place of residence. 15. On 16 October 2006 the applicant was summoned to a hearing and two days later the sum of EUR 4,000 was paid to the applicant with a view to reaching a settlement. 16. The hearing took place on 20 November 2006. According to the minutes the hearing served the purpose of establishing the plausibility of the applicant’s claims as submitted on 6 July 2001 and supplemented on 8 May 2006 and to determine their amount with the participation of the applicant. It is then noted that, in the light of the explanations given, the costs and interest claimed seemed plausible. At the close of the hearing the parties concluded a friendly settlement with the following terms: “(a) Klagenfurt University thus declares its willingness to transfer, in addition to the payment already made of EUR 4,000 and the regulated transport costs in the amount of EUR 5,699.21, the lump-sum of EUR 10,000 within 14 days to the account of Professor Strobel. (b) Professor Strobel, for his part, withdraws all requests in connection with the proceedings at issue. As a result, the demands and claims asserted in the present proceedings are completely settled and complied with.”",1,524

The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant’s wife died on 9 September 1987, leaving two children born in 1975 and 1981. His claim for widows’ benefits was made in November 2002 and was rejected on 26 August 2003 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows’ benefits because he was not a woman. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law. The applicant was not in receipt of child benefit at the time of his claim. The domestic law relevant to this application is set out in Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, §§ 1426, ECHR 2002-IV and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, §§ 40-41, 25 July 2007.",0,204
986,986,"The applicant, Mr Philip Boivin, who has dual Belgian and French nationality, was born in 1966 and lives in Bornem (Belgium). He was represented before the Court by Mr F. Krenc, a lawyer practising in Brussels. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. The European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (“Eurocontrol”) was created in 1960 for the purpose of supervising air traffic control in the airspace of its member States, which have included Belgium and France since the beginning. By a decision of Eurocontrol’s Director General dated 6 September 1995, the applicant was appointed to the post of chief accountant at the Institute of Air Navigation Services (a body which is part of Eurocontrol and is situated in Luxembourg) for a renewable term of five years. On 29 February 1996 Eurocontrol’s Director of Human Resources notified the applicant that his appointment had been cancelled following a complaint by another official of the organisation who claimed that there had been no notice of competition for the vacancy filled by the applicant. After a specific competition the applicant was appointed again. However, the same official challenged the applicant’s new appointment on the ground that there had been no substantiated report and obtained its cancellation. A fresh recruitment procedure was organised to fill the vacancy. However, the applicant’s name was not included on the list of qualified candidates drawn up by the new selection board. As a result, Eurocontrol’s Director General decided not to appoint him to the post. On 18 January 1999 the organisation’s Director of Human Resources sent the applicant a letter notifying him of the termination of his employment on 31 January 1999 and inviting him to discuss compensation with the legal department. After filing a number of internal administrative complaints, the applicant took his case to the International Labour Organisation’s Administrative Tribunal (the “ILOAT” – having sole competence to settle all disputes between Eurocontrol and its staff) to challenge the cancellation of his appointment and to seek compensation for the injury caused to him. In a judgment of 3 November 2000 (notified to the applicant on 12 February 2001), the ILOAT, finding that the recruitment procedure had not been flawed, upheld the decisions cancelling the applicant’s appointment. However, observing that Eurocontrol had “fail[ed] in its duty ... to protect [the applicant] from the injury caused by the quashing of an appointment he [had] accepted in good faith”, the ILOAT partly granted the applicant’s compensation claim and awarded him 220,000 euros in damages. The International Convention relating to Cooperation for the Safety of Air Navigation (the “Eurocontrol Convention”), signed in Brussels on 13 December 1960, established, as provided in Article 1, a European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) to create a uniform European air traffic management system. Article 4 of the Eurocontrol Convention provides that “[t]he Organisation shall have legal personality”. Under Article V § 2 of Eurocontrol’s Statute, annexed to the Eurocontrol Convention, the ILOAT has “sole jurisdiction in disputes between the Organisation and the personnel of the Agency, to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of all other courts and tribunals, national or international”. The International Labour Organisation was founded in 1919 as the “International Labour Office” and since 1946 has operated as a tripartite agency of the United Nations that brings together representatives of governments, employers and workers from its member States. Its Administrative Tribunal hears complaints from officials or former officials of the International Labour Organisation and the other international organisations that have recognised its jurisdiction. The relevant provisions of the Tribunal’s Statute are as follows: “... 5. The Tribunal shall also be competent to hear complaints alleging non-observance, in substance or in form, of the terms of appointment of officials and of provisions of the Staff Regulations of any other international organisation meeting the standards set out in the Annex hereto which has addressed to the Director General a declaration recognising, in accordance with its Constitution or internal administrative rules, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal for this purpose, as well as its Rules of Procedure, and which is approved by the Governing Body.” “1. The Tribunal shall take decisions by a majority vote; judgments shall be final and without appeal. 2. The reasons for a judgment shall be stated. The judgment shall be communicated in writing to the Director General of the International Labour Office and to the complainant. ...” Article XII § 1 of the Annex to the ILOAT’s Statute reads as follows: “In any case in which the Executive Board of an international organisation which has made the declaration specified in Article II § 5 of the Statute of the Tribunal challenges a decision of the Tribunal confirming its jurisdiction, or considers that a decision of the Tribunal is vitiated by a fundamental fault in the procedure followed, the question of the validity of the decision given by the Tribunal shall be submitted by the Executive Board concerned, for an advisory opinion, to the International Court of Justice.”",0,837

He is a former employee of the Stateowned OJSC “Pivdenelektromash” (“the Company,” ВАТ “Південелектромаш”). 5. The background facts for the case are described in the case of Semenov v. Ukraine (no. 25463/03, §§ 5-8, 13 December 2005). 6. On 5 December 2002 the Nova Kakhovka City Court (Новокаховський міський суд Херсонської області) ordered the Company to pay the applicant UAH 4,393 in salary arrears. This judgment became final and the writs of execution were transferred to the Bailiffs' Service. 7. By letters of 26 February 2003 and 15 April 2003, the Bailiffs' Service and the Kherson Regional Department of Justice informed the applicant that the enforcement proceedings had been suspended due to the proceedings of financial rehabilitation of the debtor. 8. On 11 August 2003 the Nova Kakhovka City Court rejected the applicant's complaint about the allegedly unlawful inactivity of the Bailiffs' Service. The court stated that there was no fault attributable to the defendant. 9. On 15 January 2004 the Bailiffs' Service resumed the execution proceedings in the applicant's case. On 23 January and 10 February 2004, it ordered the seizure of the Company's accounts. However, on 27 February 2004 the Kherson Regional Commercial Court, on the trustee's appeal, quashed these decisions because the Bankruptcy Act envisaged the obligatory suspension of enforcement proceedings pending the resolution of a bankruptcy case. 10. The judgment in the applicant's favour remains unenforced. 11. The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgments of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-18, 27 July 2004) and Trykhlib v. Ukraine (no. 58312/00, §§ 25-32, 20 September 2005).",0,280
990,990,"10. The Court is called upon to rule only on the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) in the present cases. Thus, as regards the facts the Court will confine itself here to giving a brief outline and for the rest it refers to paragraphs 15 to 43 of its judgment of 18 June 1971. 11. That judgment concerned the detention of De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp ordered by decisions of the magistrates at Charleroi, Namur and Brussels on 19 April 1966, 21 December 1965 and 4 November 1965 respectively under Sections 13 (in the cases of De Wilde and Versyp) and 16 (in the case of Ooms) of the Act of 27 November 1891 for the suppression of vagrancy and begging. De Wilde regained his freedom after a little less than seven months (three of which he spent serving a prison sentence), Ooms after one year and Versyp after one year, nine months and six days. 12. In the course of the proceedings before the Commission, the applicants each claimed 500 Belgian francs (BF) damages per day of detention. Their counsel, Me. Magnée, now relies on the judgment of 18 June 1971 to claim, on behalf of each of them, damages of 300 BF per day of ""unlawful detention"". With that object, Me. Magnée began by addressing to the Belgian Minister of Justice, on 22 and 30 June 1971, two letters of which the first related to Versyp and the second to Ooms. On 12 July, the Minister replied that the Government could only apply the law as it stood while waiting for the Bill on ""social misfits"" - which it had introduced even before the judgment of 18 June 1971 - to be passed. Considering this reply to amount to a refusal contrary to the principle of the supremacy of international treaty law over national law, Me. Magnée informed the Minister, on 14 July that he proposed to bring the matter before the ""competent authorities"" and to notify the Commission. Counsel for the applicants did in fact write first to the Committee of Ministers - 16 July - to inform them of the Minister of Justice’s refusal which implied, he alleged, a violation of the Court’s judgment; he later wrote, on 23 July, to the Commission referring to Articles 5 (5), 48 and 50 (art. 5-5, art. 48, art. 50) of the Convention and requested the Commission to bring before the Court the claim made by each of his three clients. On 2 August, he addressed to the Minister of Justice a letter concerning De Wilde which was worded in the same terms as the letters of 22 and 30 June. The Minister acknowledged its receipt on 12 August, noting that along with the other two it had been communicated by Me. Magnée to the Commission. 13. In its memorial of 27 October 1971, the Government pointed out to the Court that on 17 June 1971 it had tabled in Parliament a Bill on ""social misfits"" intended to replace the 1891 Act. The Government added that, desiring to comply with the judgment of 18 June 1971 without awaiting the passage of this Bill, it had voted by Parliament an Act of 6 August 1971 amending the 1891 Act and containing two sections. The first, which inserted a new section, numbered 16 bis, in the 1891 Act, provides that decisions taken under Sections 13 and 16 are henceforth made subject to the remedies available under the Code of Criminal Procedure, including appeal. Section 2 was a transitional provision: it specified that vagrants or beggars held in detention on the entry into force of the 1971 Act (4 September 1971) in execution of a decision taken under Section 13 or Section 16 of the 1891 Act, could exercise for a period of one month the remedy provided for at Section 16 bis.",0,645

According to the records provided by the Government, on 18 February 2002 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant in connection with one episode of smuggling forty electronic devices of the same type, intended for military use. On 9 October 2002 and 18 November 2002 criminal proceedings were instituted against Mr K. and Ms T., respectively, in connection with the same episode of smuggling. 7. On 7 October 2002 the applicant was arrested on the suspicion that he had committed the above crime. On 10 October 2002 the Shevchenkivsky District Court of Kyiv ordered the applicant’s detention on remand relying on the suspicion that he had committed a crime punishable by imprisonment. It also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might leave Ukraine and obstruct the investigation. 8. On 22 November 2002 the proceedings against the applicant, Mr K. and Ms. T. were joined. 9. On an unspecified date in March 2003 the applicant’s criminal case was sent to the Konotop Court for consideration. 10. On 4 April 2003, 22 August 2003, and 10 October 2003 the Konotop Court dismissed the applicant’s requests for release, having found that the detention on remand had been ordered at the investigation stage in accordance with law and that there was no reason to replace it with another preventive measure. 11. On 8 December 2003 the Konotop Court convicted the applicant of smuggling, abuse of authority and tax evasion. The court sentenced the applicant to eleven years’ imprisonment. 12. On 15 April 2004 the Sumy Regional Court of Appeal quashed that judgment and remitted the case for a new consideration to the Krolevetsky Court. By the same ruling, the court of appeal continued the applicant’s remand in custody without indicating any reason. 13. On 5 May 2004 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s and Mr K.’s requests for leave to appeal in cassation against the decision of 15 April 2004. 14. On 7 December 2004 the applicant lodged a request for release which was dismissed the same day. The Krolevetsky Court found that the detention on remand had been ordered at the investigation stage in accordance with law and that there was no reason to replace it with another preventive measure. 15. On 20 January 2005 the Krolevetsky Court ordered an expert examination of the smuggled devices. 16. On 11 April 2005 the applicant lodged a request with the trial court asking the court to lift the preventive measure of detention. On 14 April 2005 the court dismissed his request, having found that the detention on remand had been ordered at the investigation stage in accordance with law and that there was no reason to replace it with another preventive measure. 17. On 30 January 2006 the expert report was sent to the court. 18. According to the records provided by the Government, between 15 April 2005 and 31 March 2006 the Krolevetsky Court scheduled no hearings. 19. On 12 May 2006 the Krolevetsky Court convicted the applicant of smuggling, abuse of authority and tax evasion. The court sentenced the applicant to four years’ imprisonment with confiscation of his movable property. 20. On 10 August 2006 the Sumy Regional Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of 12 May 2006 with minor amendments. 21. On 8 May 2007 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s request for leave to appeal in cassation. 22. While the criminal proceedings against the applicant were pending, the applicant unsuccessfully sought institution of criminal proceedings against the persons who prepared the expert reports in his criminal case. 23. Provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 28 December 1960 on preventive measures are set out in Nevmerzhitsky v. Ukraine (no. 54825/00, § 54, ECHR 2005II (extracts)).",1,661
1003,1003,"5. The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Ljubljana. 6. The applicant is the director and sole owner of the limited liability company Energohit d.o.o., which provides consultancy, engineering and representation services. 7. On 25 October 1996 the applicant, representing his company Energohit, instituted enforcement proceedings against another company, L., for the payment of a bill for 887,250 Slovenian tolars (SIT). On 5 November 1996 the Ljubljana Local Court, relying on a valid purchase order submitted by the applicant’s company, upheld his request. The operative part of the court’s decision stated that company L. should pay the debt to the applicant’s company and that, if not paid, this claim should be enforced. 8. Company L. lodged an objection. It argued that the purchase order to which the applicant’s company referred had not been signed by it but by another company. Following the objection, the Ljubljana Local Court, on 9 December 1996, set aside its enforcement decision and the case was transferred to the Ljubljana District Court to decide on the dispute. 9. Further to the Ljubljana Local Court’s decision of 9 December 1996, the proceedings, which were governed by legislation concerning commercial disputes, were conducted before the Ljubljana District Court. The latter held three hearings, the first one on 16 February 2000. On 20 April 2000 the court upheld the applicant’s company’s claim for SIT 523,250 and rejected the remainder finding that it had already been paid. The judgment was served on the applicant’s company on 29 August 2000. 10. Following an appeal by company L., the judgment was quashed on 19 September 2002. Subsequently, the Ljubljana District Court re-examined the case, and, after holding two hearings, rejected the applicant’s company’s claim on 28 March 2003. The judgment was served on the applicant’s company on 8 July 2003. 11. Further to the applicant’s company’s appeal, the second judgment was also quashed (on 20 May 2004) and the case was re-examined at a new hearing held by the Ljubljana District Court on 22 October 2004. On that date the court upheld the claim for the sum of SIT 523,250 in a judgment, which was served on the applicant’s company on 28 January 2005. Company L.’s appeal was rejected by the Ljubljana Higher Court on 16 June 2005. On that date the judgment of 22 October 2004 became final and enforceable. The Ljubljana Higher Court’s judgment was served on the applicant’s company on 9 July 2005. 12. On 5 October 2005 the applicant’s company lodged a request for execution of the above judgment against company L.’s monetary assets, movable and immovable property. The applicant was twice asked to supplement the request with the necessary documents. On 20 December 2005 the Ljubljana Local Court gave a decision allowing the enforcement. 13. On 23 February 2006 the court appointed an enforcement officer. 14. On 12 May 2006 the applicant’s company asked the court to order company L. to supply a list of its assets. On 22 May 2006 the court issued an order in line with the applicant’s company’s request. On 21 June 2006 company L. supplied the list. 15. On 5 January 2007 the court decided that the seizure of company L.’s immovable property should be considered in separate proceedings, which were discontinued, presumably without success, on 11 June 2008. Subsequently, the applicant’s company was requested to specify which further assets could be subject to the enforcement. 16. Further to receiving a letter from company L.’s bank noting that there were no monetary assets and no transactions on its bank account, the court, on 25 March 2009, discontinued this aspect of the enforcement. The applicant’s company lodged an appeal, which was rejected on 17 June 2009 by the Ljubljana Higher Court. 17. On 25 September 2009 the enforcement officer informed the court that company L. had moved from its address, which was brought to the applicant’s company’s attention. On 15 February 2010 the applicant’s company informed the court of the new address. 18. In the course of the proceedings the applicant’s company twice requested a review of alleged irregularities in the process of execution; however, no decision appears to have been issued in reply to these requests. 19. On 13 July 2010 company L. was removed from the register of companies following a request by the tax authorities to that effect. As a result, the enforcement proceedings were discontinued on 21 December 2010. The applicant’s company did not request that the enforcement be continued against potential active shareholders in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Financial Operations, Insolvency Proceedings and Compulsory Dissolution Act. 20. The Protection of the Right to Trial without Undue Delay Act (Official Gazette nos. 49/2006 and 58/2009 – “the 2006 Act”) entered into force on 17 May 2006. On 1 January 2007 it became operational and has been implemented since that date. It applies to parties to court proceedings, participants in proceedings conducted under the statute regulating non-contentious procedure, and injured parties in criminal proceedings. 21. According to the 2006 Act, a claimant may use a supervisory appeal and a motion for deadline in order to expedite the proceedings. In addition to these acceleratory remedies, the 2006 Act also provides for the opportunity to obtain redress by means of a compensatory remedy, namely by bringing a claim for compensation. With regard to a compensatory remedy, the 2006 Act provides that two cumulative conditions must be satisfied in order for a party to be able to lodge a claim for compensation. Firstly, during the proceedings the applicant must have successfully availed himself of the supervisory appeal or have lodged a motion for a deadline, regardless of the outcome. Secondly, the proceedings must have been terminated.",1,948

In November 1992, the applicant, accused of belonging to a criminal association and of drug-trafficking, was arrested. The suspicions against him were partly based on the content of certain wiretappings. In an order of 5 May 1994, the investigating judge committed the applicant for trial, commencing on 21 October 1994 before the Nola District Court. In a judgment of 5 May 1995, filed with the registry on 31 May 1995, the District Court, relying on the content of the wiretappings, sentenced the applicant to thirteen years imprisonment. The applicant and the Public Prosecutor lodged an appeal with the Naples Court of Appeal.

The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr D. Walton of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant received a notice of intended prosecution pursuant to section 172 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, requiring him to name the driver of his car on 28 September 2005. He confirmed that he had been driving his car at that time. On 6 October 2005 the police made a conditional offer of a fixed penalty amounting to GBP 60 and a three penalty point endorsement on his licence, which the applicant accepted and paid.

1008,1008,"The applicant is a British citizen born in 1961 and currently detained in HM Prison Old Elvet, Durham. Before the Court, he is represented by Mr. B.T. Row, a solicitor practising in Newcastle. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 17 June 1993 the applicant was arrested and, together with his brother, charged with burglary and conspiracy to commit burglary. After being charged, the applicant and his brother were released on conditional bail. Committal papers were served on the defence on 21 September 1993, following the completion of the police investigation. The applicant’s representatives requested an “old style” committal hearing, which would have involved hearing oral evidence from ten prosecution witnesses over two days. It was not possible for the North Tyneside Magistrates Court to schedule a two-day hearing before 4 January 1994. On that date the defence decided to proceed on the basis of written statements under the shortened committal procedure (provided for by section 6(2) of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980). The case was then committed for trial to Newcastle Crown Court. On 25 February 1994 there was a pre-trial hearing to ascertain the pleas of the accused and to give directions for trial. The applicant and his brother pleaded not guilty and were released on bail. In a letter received on 21 April 1994, the applicant’s solicitors wrote to the court asking for the case not to be listed for eight weeks to enable them to obtain the report of a forensics expert. In a letter received on 8 June 1994, they asked for a further delay of six weeks. Finally, in a letter received on 8 July 1994 they asked that the trial not be listed until September or October 1994 to enable them to obtain medical evidence. The trial, which was estimated to require three weeks and involve hearing evidence from 58 witnesses, was listed for 3 July 1995. However, the applicant failed to appear at the trial. In his application he explained that “because of threats which [he] was receiving from the persons actually responsible for the offences for which [he] stood charged, [he] failed to attend court. [He] ... stayed at home to protect [his] family from known criminals who would have caused harm to [his] family”. The applicant was arrested on 28 July 1995 and remanded in custody. The trial was next scheduled for 4 March 1996. On that date, the applicant’s co-accused brother failed to appear and the case was again adjourned. On 22 April 1996 there was a further pre-trial directions hearing. Three possible trial dates were proposed: 17 June, 12 August and 4 November 1996. However, the applicant’s counsel, who had acted for him from the outset and whom the applicant wished to represent him at trial, was not available on 17 June, and it was not possible for the trial to take place on 12 August 1996 because of the unavailability of a number of witnesses. The trial was, therefore, fixed for 4 November 1996. The applicant was remanded in custody until then. At the trial, both the applicant and his brother pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to burgle. The applicant was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment.",0,539
1009,1009,"The applicant, Dragomir Hadžić, is a Croatian citizen, born in 1931 and living in Zagreb. He is represented before the Court by Mr Milorad Lukač, a lawyer practising in Zagreb. The respondent Government are represented by their Agent Ms Lidija Lukina-Karajković. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant served as a dentist in the Yugoslav People’s Army (YPA) from 1959 to 1991. His post was in Zagreb, Croatia. By an order of the Commander of the Fifth Military Zone of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of 4 June 1991 it was decided that, due to his age, the applicant’s military service would end on 31 December 1991. Subsequently, by a decision of the Belgrade Military Social Security Fund (Zavod za socijalno osiguranje vojnih osiguranika) of 25 December 1991, the applicant’s right to an old-age pension was recognised as from 1 January 1992. The applicant’s pension was subsequently paid from the Yugoslav Federal Military Social Security Fund in Belgrade until 31 December 1993. According to the Government the payments stopped on that date at the applicant’s personal request, as he had decided to file an application for a pension in Croatia. According to the applicant on 4 January 1994 he obtained Croatian citizenship and, consequently, only then fulfilled the requirements to apply for a pension in Croatia. On 4 January 1994 the applicant filed an application for an old-age pension in Croatia. As a reason for this request the applicant submitted that he had previously fulfilled the conditions for an old-age pension and also obtained the Croatian citizenship. By a decision of 25 February 1994 the Croatian Social Security Fund - Zagreb Office (Republički fond mirovinskog i invalidskog osiguranja radnika Hrvatske - Područni ured Zagreb) rejected his request, stating that the applicant did not fulfil the requirements for a pension as he had failed to join the Croatian army prior to 31 December 1991. The applicant unsuccessfully appealed against that decision and after his appeal was rejected on 5 April 1994, he instituted proceedings before the Administrative Court (Upravni sud Republike Hrvatske). He maintained that the decision to reject his request for an old-age pension had not been adequately reasoned and had failed to state laws on which it had been based. He maintained also that the law requesting the former YPA officers to make themselves available for the service in the Croatian army prior to 31 December 1991 had been enacted on 24 July 1992, after he had already fulfilled the conditions for an old-age pension. Furthermore, as that law had been enacted only in 1992 he could not have known the above requirement prior to his retirement form service. On 22 December 1994 the Administrative Court rejected his claim. It noted that the applicant’s active military service in the YPA had come to an end on 31 December 1991 and that at that moment he fulfilled the requirements for the old-age pension according to the Yugoslav Federal law. It found furthermore that the applicant had failed to make himself available for service in the Croatian army prior to 31 December 1991, as prescribed by the 1993 Former Yugoslav People’s Army Officers’ Pensions Act. Therefore, he had failed to fulfil the requirements for recognition of his pension rights in Croatia, as prescribed by law. On 1 March 1995 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint claiming that his right to property was violated by the Administrative Court’s decision in so far as his right to pension in Croatia was denied. He argued in particular that the 1993 Former Yugoslav People’s Army Officers’ Pensions Act had not required that he join the Croatian army. On 30 June 1998 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) rejected the applicant’s complaint. It followed the reasoning set out in the Administrative Court’s decision of 22 December 1994 and found that the applicant’s constitutional rights had not been violated. The relevant parts of the Former Yugoslav People’s Army Officers’ Pensions Act (1993 - Zakon o ostvarivanju prava iz mirovnskog i invalidskog osigurnja pripadnika bivše JNA, Official Gazette no. 96/1993) read as follows: “A person whose status as an active officer in the former YPA in the territory of the Republic of Croatia ended prior to 31 December 1991, and who had not until that date obtained rights from pension and invalidity insurance may obtain such rights if he fulfils the conditions required of army personnel in order to obtain rights concerning pension and invalidity insurance in accordance with the Military Personnel Pensions Act (Zakon o mirovinskom i invalidskom osiguranju vojnih osiguranika – Official Gazette no. 53/91, 73/91, 18/92 and 71/92) and if: ... – he had made himself available for the service in the Croatian army prior to 31 December 1991...” By its decision of 16 October 1991 the Croatian Government, inter alia, guranteed to the Yugoslav People’s Army officers and soldiers who voluntarily left the YPA troops based on Croatian territory prior to 10 November 1991 at midnight the following: personal safety, the same status as they had in the YPA and an organised and unhindered possibility to leave the territory of Croatia for those who wished to do so.",0,866
1010,1010,"4. The applicant was born in 1935 and lives in Beograd. 5. On 16 July 2001 the applicant, along with fourteen other individuals, instituted civil proceedings against his former employer seeking payment of certain sums of money. 6. On 13 August 2003 the Beograd Fourth Municipal Court declared the action inadmissible because the plaintiffs' lawyer had failed to submit a full list of plaintiffs and their addresses, a specification of their claims and a power of attorney. 7. On appeal, on 28 April 2004 the Beograd District Court quashed the first-instance decision and remitted the case. It found that the plaintiffs' lawyer had supplied the requested documents and that the case was suitable for examination on its merits. 8. On 16 November 2004 the applicant filed a complaint with the Supreme Court concerning the length of the proceedings. The Supreme Court forwarded that complaint to the president of the Beograd Fourth Municipal Court, who, having reviewed the case file, informed the applicant that the next hearing in his case was scheduled for 22 December 2004. 9. At the hearing held on that date, the court decided to split the claims made by the various plaintiffs into separate proceedings and another judge was appointed to hear the applicant's case. The newly appointed judge ordered the joinder of the applicant's case to the initial case file, but was unable to obtain that file until 11 June 2005. 10. The court apparently held hearings on 19 January, 11 April, 6 June, 3 July and 23 October 2006. 11. On 5 April 2007 the first-instance court gave judgment in the case and, according to the information provided by the parties to date, the proceedings are currently pending before the second-instance court following the applicant's appeal. 12. The relevant provisions of this legislation are set out in the V.A.M. v. Serbia judgment (no. 39177/05, §§ 70-72, 13 March 2007). 13. Sections 359, 360 and 361 of this Code define abuse of office (zloupotreba službenog položaja), judicial malfeasance (kršenje zakona od strane sudije) and official malfeasance (nesavestan rad u službi) as separate criminal offences. 14. Article 25 of the Serbian Constitution (Ustav Republike Srbije), published in the Official Gazette of the Socialist Republic of Serbia (OG SRS - no. 1/90), provided as follows: “Everyone shall be entitled to compensation for any pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages suffered due to the unlawful or improper conduct of a State official, a State body or a public authority, in accordance with the law. Such damages shall be met by the Republic of Serbia or the public authority [in question].” 15. This Constitution was repealed on 8 November 2006, which is when the “new” Constitution (published in OG RS no. 98/06) entered into force. 16. The substance of Article 35 § 2 of the new Constitution corresponds, in its relevant part, to the above-cited text of the previous Article 25.",1,479
1012,1012,"The applicants, H.P., born in 1941, E.M., born in 1932, R.B., born in 1936, G.P., born in 1945, and M.G., born in 1943, are all Austrian nationals. They are living in Spittal/Drau, Gladbach and Möllbrücke respectively. They are represented before the Court by Mr H. Walther, a lawyer practising in Klagenfurt. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicants and their brother are all children of a Carinthian farmer who died on 3 September 1993 without having left a will. After the death of the applicants’ father, inheritance proceedings commenced on 10 December 1993 when their conditional declaration accepting the inheritance (bedingte Erbserklärung) was registered by the Spittal/Drau District Court. On 30 December 1993, 17 May, 27 June, 18 October 1994, and 20 March 1995, inheritance negotiation hearings were held by the court commissioner in the competent notary’s office. As the applicants and their brother were unable to reach an agreement, on 13 July 1995 the proceedings were transferred to the District Court which held hearings on 18 September, 23 October, 20 November 1995 and 15 January 1996. On the latter date the court ruled that the applicants and their brother had already, on 30 December 1993, entered into a valid agreement concerning the estate and appointed the applicants’ brother as the principal heir (Anerbe). The latter appealed against this decision arguing that no agreement had been reached. On 14 February 1996 the Klagenfurt Regional Court granted his appeal and referred the case back to the District Court. The District Court continued the proceedings and took several expert opinions on the question whether the applicants’ brother was able to be the principal heir. Upon the applicants’ requests, experts were appointed on 12 July, 9 September, 21 October 1996 and 28 May 1997. On 17 June 1997 the District Court determined that the applicants’ brother was the principal heir. On 24 July 1997 the Klagenfurt Regional Court granted the applicants’ appeal and referred the case back to the District Court. On 6 August 1997 the District Court requested an expert opinion of the Carinthian Chamber of Agriculture and Forestry (Kammer für Land- und Forstwirtschaft) on the question whether the estate fulfilled the conditions of a hereditary farm (Erbhof) within the meaning of the Carinthian Hereditary Farms Act (Kärntner Erbhöfegesetz). On 18 August 1997 the District Court found that it was a hereditary farm. Further hearings were held on 30 September and 5 November 1997. On the latter date the applicants and their brother agreed on a settlement regulating the inheritance (Erbübereinkommen). The file was transferred to the notary and, at the hearing of 14 April 1998, the applicants and their brother agreed on a family arrangement regulating the division of the whole estate (Erbteilungsübereinkommen). On 6 May 1998 the District Court issued the certificate putting the statutory heir in possession of the estate (Einantwortungsurkunde). Thereupon, on 25 October 1999, the inheritance settlement was entered in the land register (Grundbuch). Section 91 of the Courts Act (Gerichtsorganisationsgesetz), which has been in force since 1 January 1990, provides as follows. ""(1) If a court is dilatory in taking any procedural step, such as announcing or holding a hearing, obtaining an expert’s report, or preparing a decision, any party may submit a request to this court for the superior court to impose an appropriate time-limit for the taking of the particular procedural step; unless sub-section (2) of this section applies, the court is required to submit the request to the superior court, together with its comments, forthwith. (2) If the court takes all the procedural steps specified in the request within four weeks after receipt, and so informs the party concerned, the request is deemed withdrawn unless the party declares within two weeks after service of the notification that it wishes to maintain its request. (3) The request referred to in sub-section (1) shall be determined with special expedition by a chamber of the superior court consisting of three professional judges, one of whom shall preside; if the court has not been dilatory, the request shall be dismissed. This decision is not subject to appeal.""",0,690

In a registered letter of 3 October 1984, the applicant informed the tenant that she intended to terminate the lease on expiry of the term on 31 December 1985 and asked her to vacate the premises by that date. 11. On 23 October 1985, she served a notice to quit on the tenant and summoned her to appear before the Milan Magistrate. 12. By a decision of 16 October 1986, which was made enforceable on 19 November 1986, the Milan Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 30 June 1988. 13. On 30 June 1988 and on 2 May 1989, the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring her to vacate the premises. 14. On 1 June 1989, she served notice on the tenant informing her that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 27 June 1989. 15. Between 27 June 1989 and 25 November 1997, the bailiff made thirty-one attempts to recover possession. Each attempt proved unsuccessful, as, under the statutory provisions providing for the suspension for the staggering of evictions, the applicant was not entitled to police assistance in enforcing the order for possession. 16. On 27 December 1997, the applicant recovered possession of the apartment, because the tenant spontaneously vacated the premises. 17.

On 8 December 2007 the Żary District Court ordered his detention on remand. 7. On 22 December 2007 he was admitted to a psychiatric hospital and diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. He was discharged from the hospital on 2 January 2008. 8. On 9 April 2008 the Żary District Court gave a decision and discontinued the proceedings against the applicant. The court found it established that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged. However, he could not have been held criminally responsible as he had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. It further referred to the experts' opinion and ordered that the applicant be placed in a psychiatric hospital. 9. On the same date the court also refused the applicant's motion for release. The court considered that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant might commit another crime. 10. On 23 April 2008 the Żary District Court extended the applicant's detention until 22 September 2008. The court referred to the reasons given previously. In addition, it relied on the risk that the applicant might commit yet another offence. It stressed that it was necessary to keep the applicant in detention until his admission to a psychiatric hospital. 11. The applicant was transferred between different detention centres. After 28 March 2008 he was detained in the Nowa Sól Detention Centre. 12. On 21 May 2008 the Żary District Court was informed that the applicant had appealed against the decision of 9 April 2008. However he had filed his appeal with the Supreme Court instead of with the Regional Court. Therefore, the Supreme Court asked the lower court to examine whether the applicant's motion could be regarded as an appeal against the decision of 9 April 2008. 13. On 2 July 2008 the Zielona Góra Regional Court dismissed the applicant's appeal and upheld the decision of 9 April 2008. The court held that all the conditions for imposing the preventive measure on the applicant had been met. 14. On 7 July 2008 the Żary District Court gave a decision and ordered that the applicant be placed in the Lubiąż Psychiatric Hospital. It was also established that the applicant could be admitted to this facility on 8 August 2008. However, the applicant subsequently appealed against this decision in so far as it related to the choice of hospital and the case file was transferred to the Zielona Góra Regional Court. On 29 August 2008 the Zielona Góra Regional Court upheld the decision of 7 July 2008. 15. The applicant was admitted to the hospital on 15 September 2008. 16. It appears that he left the hospital on a later unknown date before February 2009. 17. The Code of Criminal Procedure of 1997, which entered into force on 1 September 1998, defines pre-trial detention as one of the so-called “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze). 18. A more detailed rendition of the relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of pre-trial detention (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its prolongation, release from detention and rules governing other preventive measures can be found in the Court's judgments in the cases of Gołek v. Poland (no. 31330/02, §§ 2733, 25 April 2006) and Celejewski v. Poland (no. 17584/04, §§ 2223, 4 August 2006). 19.

1023,1023,"The applicant, Mr Janusz Koral, is a Polish national who was born in 1953 and lives in Opinogόra, Poland. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On an unspecified date in 1989 criminal proceedings were instituted against J.K., the applicant's neighbour who assaulted and seriously injured him. The applicant joined the proceedings before the Ciechanów District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) as a civil party and lodged a claim for compensation against the defendant (powództwo adhezyjne). He also participated in them as the so-called “auxiliary prosecutor” (oskarżyciel posiłkowy). The proceedings were terminated on 25 June 2002. On 12 February 1999, the date on which the application was lodged with the Court, they were pending before the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy). On 17 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”) entered into force. It lays down various legal means designed to counteract and/or redress the undue length of judicial proceedings. Section 2 of the 2004 Act reads, in so far as relevant: Section 5 reads, in so far as relevant: “1. A complaint about the unreasonable length of proceedings shall be lodged while the proceedings are pending. ...” Section 12 provides for measures that may be applied by the court dealing with the complaint. It reads, in so far as relevant: “1. The court shall dismiss a complaint which is unjustified. 2. If the court considers that the complaint is justified, it shall find that there was an unreasonable delay in the impugned proceedings. 3. At the request of the complainant, the court may instruct the court examining the merits of the case to take certain measures within a fixed time-limit. Such instructions shall not concern the factual and legal assessment of the case. 4. If the complaint is justified the court may, at the request of the complainant, grant ... just satisfaction in an amount not exceeding PLN 10,000 to be paid by the State Treasury. If such just satisfaction is granted it shall be paid out of the budget of the court which conducted the delayed proceedings.” Section 18 lays down transitional rules in relation to the applications already pending before the Court. It reads, in so far as relevant: “1. Within six months after the date of entry into force of this law persons who, before that date, had lodged a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights ... complaining of a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time guaranteed by Article 6 (1) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ..., may lodge a complaint about the unreasonable length of the proceedings on the basis of the provisions of this law if their complaint to the Court had been lodged in the course of the impugned proceedings and if the Court has not adopted a decision concerning the admissibility of their case. ...” On 18 January 2005 Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) adopted a resolution (no. III SPP 113/04) in which it ruled that while the 2004 Act produced legal effects as from the date of its date of entry into force (17 September 2004), its provisions applied retroactively to all proceedings in which delays had occurred before that date and had not yet been remedied.",0,580
1024,1024,"The applicant, Mr Viktor Anatolyevich Davidchuk, is a Russian national who was born in 1960 and lives in the Bryansk Region. The Russian Government were initially represented by Mr P. Laptev, the former Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights, and subsequently by their Representative, Mrs V. Milinchuk. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant was questioned by the police in the absence of his lawyer and confessed to the murder of his wife. Before the questioning he had made a handwritten statement that he did not need legal assistance. On 29 May 1998 the Klintsovskiy District Court of the Bryansk Region convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to fourteen years’ imprisonment. The applicant was assisted by legal-aid counsel. The applicant appealed. In his grounds of appeal he advanced the defence of irresistible impulse and asked for a more lenient sentence. He also applied for free legal representation because he did not have sufficient means to retain counsel. He relied on Article 50 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see below). By letter of 23 April 2003, a deputy President of the Bryansk Regional Court rejected the applicant’s request for free legal assistance because “there were no right to free legal representation before appeal courts”. On 25 April 2003 the Bryansk Regional Court upheld the conviction on appeal but reduced the sentence to twelve years’ imprisonment. The applicant was not assisted by counsel. On 9 March 2006 a deputy Prosecutor General lodged an application for supervisory review with the Presidium of the Bryansk Regional Court. He submitted that the Bryansk Regional Court had infringed the applicant’s right to free legal representation. On 26 April 2006 the Presidium of the Bryansk Regional Court granted the prosecutor’s application, finding that the refusal to provide the applicant with free legal representation at the appeal hearing had violated the rights of the defence. It quashed the appeal judgment of 25 April 2003 and remitted the case for a fresh examination before the Bryansk Regional Court. On 7 July 2006 the Bryansk Regional Court held a new appeal hearing. It upheld the applicant’s conviction but reduced the sentence to eleven years’ imprisonment. On 29 December 2006 the applicant was released on parole. Article 50 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (in force from 1 July 2002) establishes that the investigator, the prosecutor or the court provide the suspect or the accused with legal aid counsel upon his/her request.",0,420

The applicant stated that he was the owner of 99 plots of land in the Districts of Kyrenia, Famagusta and Nicosia, in northern Cyprus. In support of his claim of ownership, he produced copies of the relevant affirmations of ownership issued by the Republic of Cyprus. 10. The applicant claimed that from 1974 onwards he had been deprived of his property rights, his plots of land being located in the area which was under the occupation and the overall control of the Turkish military authorities. The latter had prevented him from having access to and use of his property. 11. In a letter of 17 June 2003 the applicant’s lawyer observed that the private trading companies ""A. Solomonidis Ltd"", and ""Solomonidis & Kozolidis Ltd"" were not the owners of the properties claimed in the application, the original and only owner being the applicant, Mr Antonakis Solomonides.",1,175
1032,1032,"The applicant, Mr Giorgos Galanis, is a Greek national, who was born in 1948 and lives in Athens. He was represented before the Court by Mr S. Tsakyrakis, a lawyer practising in Athens. The Government were represented by Mr V. Kyriazopoulos, Senior Adviser, State Legal Council, and Mrs M. Papida, Legal Assistant, State Legal Council. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant graduated from the Pedagogical Academy of Larissa in 1968. The Pedagogical Academies were, at the time, the only institutions training the future teachers of elementary schools and all graduates were eligible for appointment to the public school system. After graduation the applicant moved to Sweden where he worked as a teacher of Greek language at the elementary school of Stockholm from 1978 untill 1984. In 1984 he returned with his wife and three children to live permanently in Greece. On 14 August 1984 he applied to the Ministry of National Education and Religion asking to be appointed as a teacher to a Greek public school. The appointments were made according to a seniority list comprising all persons having the necessary qualifications, mainly a degree from a Pedagogical Academy. The immediate result of his application should have been his registration in the list, so that he could be appointed when his turn would come. On 24 September 1984 the Ministry rejected his application and returned his documents because the applicant was a Jehovah’s Witness. The Ministry indicated that according to an opinion of the State Legal Council, it was prohibited for persons believing in religions or dogmas other than the Greek Orthodox to be appointed as teachers. Four years later Law 1771/1988 was enacted and explicitly provided in section 16 that persons believing in religions or dogmas other than the Greek Orthodox were eligible for appointment as teachers. Immediately after the enactment of that law the applicant resubmitted his application asking to be registered in the list of 1984. However, the Ministry registered him on the 1988 list. By the end of 1990 all those who were on the 1984 list had been appointed, but not those who were on the 1988 list. By 1996 the applicant realised that, with the pace the appointments were made, he would not be appointed at all. In effect, Law 1566/1985 provided that no one over 50 years of age could be appointed as a teacher and the applicant would become 50 years old in 1998. On 30 October 1996 he applied to the Ministry of Education asking to be considered as registered in the 1984 list, which would have resulted in his immediate appointment. On 20 December 1996 his application was rejected on the ground that Law 1771/1988 had no retroactive effect, so the applicant was not eligible for registration on the 1984 list. On 28 February 1997 the applicant applied to the Athens Administrative Court asking it to quash the decision rejecting his application. By judgment 1782/1997 of 10 November 1997 the Administrative Court dismissed the application. It held that the authorities had correctly applied Law 1771/1988 which introduced an entirely new provision regarding the appointment of non-Christian Orthodox teachers. Law 1771/1988 was not intended to interfere with the seniority lists of the past. Any possible violations of the Greek Constitution or the European Convention on Human Rights on religious freedom occurred in 1984 and should have been challenged at that time. On 29 October 1998 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court. He maintained that Law 1771/1988 did not introduce an entirely new provision but instead tried to remedy the illegal practice of the authorities to exclude all non-Christian Orthodox Greeks from employment in the public education system. If it were to be construed as not having retroactive effect, this would constitute by itself a new and direct violation of the Constitution and the Convention. By judgment 3390/2000 of 26 October 2000 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on the ground that the refusal of the authorities in 1996 did not constitute an executory administrative act, but it was a mere repetition of the initial refusal of 1984 and the subsequent registration in the 1988 list and as such could not be subjected to judicial review. In particular, the Supreme Administrative Court held that : “Since the applicant challenged neither the initial refusal of his request nor his subsequent registration in the seniority list of 1988, which contained an omission to register him in the list of 1984, the final decision of the Minister of National Education ... has not an executory character and the applicant’s action against it must be dismissed as inadmissible ...”. Article 16 of Law 1771/1988 provides as follows: “1. Primary education and kindergarten teachers of another dogma or religion who are candidates for appointment will be appointed and placed in public primary schools with more than one teaching posts ... as the case may be, provided that they meet the qualifications of Articles 12 and 13 of Law 1566/1985. 2. In the cases of the above-mentioned paragraph, these teachers will not teach the course of religion, except to students believing in the same dogma or religion, provided that the said course is included in the curriculum. 3. The teachers of paragraph 1 may also be appointed to primary schools and kindergartens with one teaching post, if they are students of the same dogma or religion attending that school or kindergarten.”",0,908

On an unspecified date, the applicant company instituted proceedings against another private company, claiming that the latter had failed to comply with its contractual obligations and seeking damages. On 1 April 2002 the Commercial Court (ՀՀ տնտեսական դատարան) rejected the applicant company's claims as unsubstantiated. This judgment was subject to appeal within fifteen days. No appeal was lodged so the judgment entered into force. On 26 April 2002 the Convention entered into force in respect of Armenia. On 2 February 2004 an advocate holding a special licence lodged an appeal in cassation (վճռաբեկ բողոք) with the Court of Cassation (ՀՀ վճռաբեկ դատարան) on behalf of the applicant company, seeking to reopen the proceedings on the ground of newly discovered circumstances. As a newly discovered circumstance, the advocate submitted an independent expert opinion prepared on 17 September 2003. On 27 February 2004 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal, finding that the piece of evidence adduced could not be regarded as a newly discovered circumstance having vital importance for the case. Article 221.4 of the Code of Civil Procedure of 1999 (ՀՀ քաղաքացիական դատավարության օրենսգիրք) provides that a judgment of the Commercial Court enters into force within 15 days from the date of its pronouncement. According to Articles 222, 223 and 224, judgments of the Commercial Court, which have entered into force, may be reviewed through proceedings in cassation on the basis of an appeal lodged by the Prosecutor General of Armenia and his Deputies, or by advocates holding a special license and registered with the Court of Cassation. These appeals are examined by the Court of Cassation. Article 225 provides that an appeal in cassation can be brought on points of law and procedure, or on the ground of newly discovered circumstances. There is no time-limit for lodging an appeal on the ground of newly discovered circumstances. According to Article 228, the proceedings shall be reopened on the ground of newly discovered circumstances having vital importance for the case which the parties were not or could not be aware of or which the parties were aware of but were unable to present them in court for valid reasons. According to Articles 235 and 236, the Court of Cassation reviews the judgments within the grounds presented in the appeal.

Before the judge, one of the applicants, Göksel Avcı alleged that he had been subjected to ill-treatment while in custody. 11. On 8 May 2001 the applicants' representative filed an objection with the court requesting that Ertuğrul Saraçoğlu, Göksel Avcı and Ali Kemal Mart be released.

1049,1049,"5. The applicant, Ms Tibor Ipolyné Daróczy, is a Hungarian national who was born in 1933 and lives in Budapest. 6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 7. In 1950 the applicant married Mr Tibor Ipoly Daróczy. According to birth certificate no. 1786/1927 Mr Daróczy was entitled to bear the two above-mentioned forenames from the very moment of his birth. Her husband signed the marriage certificate as “Tibor Daróczy”. The applicant chose to bear her husband’s name by putting the suffix “-né” referring to the marriage (házasságra utaló toldás) after the first given name (Tibor) of her husband. In accordance with the widespread custom in Hungary, the latter only used his first given name even in official contexts. The applicant’s married name was registered as Tiborné Daróczy on the marriage certificate. 8. The official before whom the marriage took place did not observe that the name chosen was against the law since, at the material time, a woman could only choose to bear the whole name of her husband, including all the given names. In the present case, the applicant’s correct married name should have been Tibor Ipolyné Daróczy. 9. The mistake was not revealed in 1954 when identity cards were introduced in Hungary. The applicant’s renewed identity card issued in 1974 also contained the name Tiborné Daróczy. The applicant used this name in all official and private business. In particular, her social security card and tax identification certificate were issued in the name Tiborné Daróczy. 10. In 1984 Hungary introduced electronic data recording. In the new State Registry (Állami Népességnyilvántartó) the applicant’s name was automatically entered in the manner prescribed by law, as Tibor Ipolyné Daróczy. However, she did not receive any official notification of this fact. In 1994 she and her husband were entered on the electoral register (választói névjegyzék) under the names Tibor Daróczy and Tiborné Daróczy. This database relied on the general State Registry. 11. In 1996 the applicant’s husband died. The applicant then used the name Tiborné Daróczy with the prefix “özv.” indicating that she was a widow. 12. In 2004 the applicant lost her identity card. Based on the State Registry, the Registry Office issued a new card which indicated her name as the widow of Tibor Ipoly Daróczy (özv. Tibor Ipolyné Daróczy). On 13 January 2005 the applicant obtained an official certificate containing this name. The certificate’s only function was to enable her to access her bank account since her new identity card contained a name that was different from the one she had used when opening the account. The text of the certificate expressly stated that it had been issued for one-time use. 13. The applicant lodged a complaint with the Ministry of the Interior, seeking permission to bear the name Tiborné Daróczy. In November 2004 the Ministry informed her that, since her husband’s official name was Tibor Ipoly Daróczy, she was entitled and obliged to bear that name in its entirety as a widow, and that it was not possible to change it to another form.

1059,1059,"1. The applicant, Mr Paul Tucka, is a British national who was born in 1964 and lives in Evesham. 2. 3. In 2006 the applicant was arrested and charged with gross indecency. He was subsequently also charged with rape. The charge of rape related to an incident alleged to have occurred while the complainant was between ten and eleven years of age. It was not reported to the police until she was 21 years old. 4. On 12 June 2007 the applicant was convicted of one count of rape and thirteen counts of gross indecency. He was sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment, including fifteen years for the rape count. 5. The applicant appealed against conviction and sentence. On 29 September 2008 the Court of Appeal rejected his appeal against conviction. However, it reduced the sentence of imprisonment in respect of the rape count to ten years. His total sentence was therefore one of fifteen years’ imprisonment. 6. The applicant immediately applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (“CCRC” – see below) to have his case referred to the Court of Appeal. No copy of the application has been provided to the Court and the grounds for the request to the CCRC are unknown. 7. On 10 May 2010, the CCRC notified the applicant that it had decided not to refer his case to the Court of Appeal. The decision of the CCRC has not been provided to the Court, despite specific requests on 7 October 2010 and 10 November 2010. 8. Section 9 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 (“the 1995 Act”) sets out the power of the CCRC to refer a case to the Court of Appeal and provides: “(1) Where a person has been convicted of an offence on indictment in England and Wales, the Commission— (a) may at any time refer the conviction to the Court of Appeal, and (b) (whether or not they refer the conviction) may at any time refer to the Court of Appeal any sentence (not being a sentence fixed by law) imposed on, or in subsequent proceedings relating to, the conviction.” 9. Section 13 of the 1995 Act provides: “1) A reference of a conviction, verdict, finding or sentence shall not be made under any of sections 9 to 12 unless— (a) the Commission consider that there is a real possibility that the conviction, verdict, finding or sentence would not be upheld were the reference to be made, (b) the Commission so consider— (i) in the case of a conviction, verdict or finding, because of an argument, or evidence, not raised in the proceedings which led to it or on any appeal or application for leave to appeal against it, or (ii) in the case of a sentence, because of an argument on a point of law, or information, not so raised, and (c) an appeal against the conviction, verdict, finding or sentence has been determined or leave to appeal against it has been refused. (2) Nothing in subsection (1)(b)(i) or (c) shall prevent the making of a reference if it appears to the Commission that there are exceptional circumstances which justify making it.”",0,522
1061,1061,"The applicant is a Russian citizen, born in 1942 and living in Poltava, Ukraine. In 1990 the applicant's son, an army officer, was sent to serve in the Soviet military unit in Eberswalde, Germany. On 9 October 1991 he informed his parents over the phone that he would be leaving for his home leave in Ukraine by car. Following this announcement he disappeared. On 25 November 1991 the military authorities initiated a criminal investigation into his disappearance on the suspicion of his having deserted his duty station after failing to return at the end of his leave. Since then the applicant has addressed numerous letters to various authorities concerning the fate of his son. On 27 December 1991 the military prosecutor informed the applicant that he had contacted the German authorities with a request for assistance in establishing his son's whereabouts. On 2 March 1992 the military prosecutor announced that the German authorities had not yet reported anything positive and that the applicant's theory of his son possibly being in a city hospital had not been proved to be true. On 29 June 1992 the military prosecutor informed the applicant that the authorities of Poland, Belarus and Ukraine had also been involved in the investigation of his son's whereabouts. In January 1993 the applicant visited his son's military duty station in Germany. During his visit he had the possibility of acquainting himself with his son's case file and of discussing the matter with the investigative authorities as well as with his son's fellow servicemen. On 18 February 1993 the military prosecutor assured the applicant of the continuing active search for his son. On 23 April 1993 the military prosecutor informed the applicant that, based on the reply by the German authorities, his son had not been found in any of the German medical or military establishments. On 30 July 1993 the military prosecutor stated that the physical search for his son in the territory of foreign States could only be carried out by the authorities of those States and that search requests had been sent to the German, Polish, Belarus and Ukrainian authorities. In 1993 the military unit in which the applicant's son had served was withdrawn from Germany and stationed in Russia. It appears that on an unspecified date in 1992 the criminal investigation had been suspended. The investigation, however, recommenced prior to April 1993, apparently after an intervention by the Prosecutor General's office. On 30 December 1993 the Prosecutor General's office stated that the reason for continuing the investigation was the fact that it had been inadequate. On 5 March 1994 the applicant was informed that the basis of the investigation had been changed as the probable cause of his son's disappearance was murder rather than desertion. On 21 May 1994 the criminal investigation was suspended again. Following an intervention by the military prosecutor of the Moscow Military Region, who considered that the investigation had been inadequate, the proceedings recommenced on 20 October 1994. On 4 April 1995 the criminal investigation was once more suspended. On 21 February 1996 the military prosecutor of the Moscow Military Region stated that, despite the suspension of the preliminary investigation, the search for the applicant's son's whereabouts was continuing. However, the efforts of the German and Polish authorities, as well as of the Interpol national offices in Russia and Ukraine, had not led to a positive result. On 10 November 1996 the Chief Military Prosecutor of Russia announced that, as the criminal investigation had been incomplete, the proceedings had recommenced 20 October 1996. On 20 July 1998 the Personnel Division of the Russian Ministry of Defence announced that the applicant's son no longer appeared on its staff list. The applicant has also addressed numerous letters concerning the fate of his son to the Ukrainian authorities. On 25 August 1998 the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs replied that, according to the German authorities, his son never exited the German border and that it had sent search requests to Interpol offices in 12 European countries.

1063,1063,"The applicant, Moravia Shop Invest, s.r.o., is a private company incorporated under Czech law with its head office in Prague. The Czech Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr V.A. Schorm, from the Ministry of Justice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 10 May 2000 the applicant company instituted planning proceedings (územní řízení), seeking the delivery of a planning decision on the location of a commercial building. By a public notice (veřejná vyhláška) of 7 August 2000 the Local Planning and Construction Office announced the commencement of the planning proceedings, but suspended them by a public notice of 11 October 2000 until it would be provided with a final judgment of the Brno Municipal Court (městský soud) relating to the ownership title to some of the real estates involved in the planning proceedings. This public notice was put on the notice board on 17 October 2000. On 19 October 2000 the applicant company filed a complaint alleging inactivity on the part of the Planning and Construction Office, pursuant to Article 50 of Act no. 71/1967 on the Administrative Procedure which provided for measures against inactivity of administrative authorities. On 1 November 2000 the Brno Metropolitan Office (magistrát města) dismissed the applicant company’s complaint, sharing the opinion of the Local Planning and Construction Office that the planning proceedings could be resumed after the judicial proceedings would be terminated upon a final judgment. This decision was notified to the applicant company’s representative on 9 November 2000. On 15 November 2000 the Metropolitan Office rejected the applicant company’s request for review of the decision of 11 October 2000 pursuant to Article 65 of Act no. 71/1967 which provided for review of a decision outside the formal appeal procedure (přezkoumání rozhodnutí mimo odvolací řízení). On 11 January 2001 the applicant company lodged a constitutional appeal (ústavní stížnost) in which it complained, under Articles 36 and 38 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms (Listina základních práv a svobod) and Article 6 of the Convention, of the inactivity of the administrative authorities as well as the Local Planning and Construction Office’s decision of 11 October 2000. In a decision of 11 June 2002, served on the applicant company’s lawyer on 18 June 2002, the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional appeal as having been filed outside the sixty-day statutory time-limit provided for in section 72(2) of the Constitutional Court Act finding that the company’s request for review under Article 65 of Act no. 71/1967 did not constitute a remedy for the purpose of section 72(2). Accordingly, the time-limit laid down for introducing a constitutional appeal had started running on 9 November 2000, on the date of the notification of the Metropolitan Office’s decision of 1 November 2000 to the applicant company’s representative, and had expired on 8 January 2001. The Constitutional Court added that the constitutional appeal had been filed outside the time-limit also in respect of the applicant company’s request to quash the Local Planning and Construction Office’s decision of 11 October 2000. On 31 May 2004 the Local Planning and Construction issued, in favour of a third private company, a planning decision on the location of a construction partly situated on the lands involved in the planning proceedings initiated by the applicant company in May 2000. The latter appealed, but on 6 August 2004 the Metropolitan Office upheld the planning decision. On 8 April 1998 A., a private company incorporated under Czech law, instituted proceedings against the applicant company seeking to determine the title to the real estates involved in the planning proceedings instituted by the applicant company in May 2000. On 15 October 2004 the Municipal Court found that A. was the owner of these real estates. The Regional Court upheld this judgment on 12 July 2005. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the allegedly excessive length of judicial proceedings are set out in the Court’s decision in the case of Vokurka v. Czech Republic, no. 40552/02 (dec.), §§ 11-24, 16 October 2007).",0,677
1065,1065,"The applicants are: Mr Jaroslav Šebík and Ms Jana Šternová, born in 1946 and 1949 respectively, living in Zlín and represented by V. Jablonský, a lawyer practising in Prague; Mr Josef Krejčí, born in 1928 and residing in Čachtice; Mr Jiří Beran, born in 1945 and living in Prague; Ms Johanna Kammerlander, born in 1947 and living in Vienna, Austria. They are Czech nationals. The Czech Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr V.A. Schorm, from the Ministry of Justice. The facts of the cases, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 18 October 1950 the Supreme Court (Nejvyšší soud) convicted the applicants’ father of treason, sentencing him to confiscation of all his property, which was subsequently sold and assigned to a certain P. and M. On 12 December 1988 the applicants’ father died. On 19 September 1990 the Brno Regional Court (krajský soud) declared that, pursuant to the Judicial Rehabilitation Act, his conviction and all ancillary decisions had been quashed with retrospective effect. On 31 October 1995 the applicants brought restitution proceedings before the Zlín District Court (okresní soud) against P. and M. In a judgment of 10 November 1999 the District Court dismissed the applicants’ restitution action. The court had requested an expert opinion aimed at determining whether or not the property at issue had been sold to P. and M. at an unlawfully preferential price. With reference to the expert opinion, the court held that P. and M. had acquired the property lawfully. On 14 August 2001 the Regional Court upheld the merits of the District Court’s judgment, which became final on 6 November 2001. On 11 June 2002 the applicants’ appeal on points of law (dovolání) was dismissed by the Supreme Court as filed outside the one-month statutory time-limit laid down by Article 240 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure then in force. On 5 December 2002 the Constitutional Court (Ústavní soud) rejected the applicants’ constitutional appeal. It held that in respect of the Regional Court’s judgment the appeal had been filed outside the sixty-day time-limit provided for by the Constitutional Court Act, taking into account the dismissal of the applicants’ appeal on point of law for their failure to respect the one-month statutory time-limit. The court further held that the applicants’ argument relating to the proceedings before the Supreme Court were manifestly ill-founded. On 18 December 1985 the applicant’s wife died. Judicial proceedings regarding her inheritance were started on 7 February 1986 and were meritoriously terminated on 23 June 2003 when the decision of the Prague Regional Court (krajský soud) of 28 May 2003 on the distribution of the inheritance became final. On 11 January 1993 a notary initiated inheritance proceedings following the death of a certain A.K. On 28 April 1994 the Písek District Court (okresní soud) held that the applicant and his wife were heirs to A.K. At the same time, it determined the net value of A.K.’s assets. The inheritance proceedings terminated with a decision of the District Court dated 30 June 2003 which became final on 9 July 2003. The applicant’s husband was the owner of real estate in various places in the Czech Republic. These estates were confiscated from him in 1945. In 1949 some of the estates were transferred to the ownership of natural persons in an assignment procedure. On 6 February 2000 the applicant’s husband died, designating the applicant as his universal heir. The application concerns the following sets of proceedings. 1. Restitution proceedings before the Semily Land Office On 10 March 1992 the applicant’s late husband initiated restitution proceedings concerning the estates in Daliměřice and Bukovina. It appears that the proceedings are still pending. 2. Restitution proceedings before the Jablonec nad Nisou Land Office On 14 July 1992 the applicant’s late husband lodged a claim for the restitution of the real estate in Besedice, Chlístov u Železného Brodu, Jenišovice u Jablonce nad Nisou, Koberovy, Líšný, Vranové, Vrát and Železný Brod with the Jablonec nad Nisou Land Office. It appears that the proceedings are still pending. 3. Restitution proceedings before the Liberec Land Office On 23 November 1992 the applicant’s late husband lodged a claim for the restitution of the estate in Žďárek u Sychrova with the Liberec Land Office. It appears that the proceedings are still pending. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings are stated in the Court’s decision in the case of Vokurka v. Czech Republic, no. 40552/02 (dec.), §§ 11-24, 16 October 2007).",0,755
1067,1067,"6. The applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Chişinău. 7. On 25 May 2005 the applicant was arrested by the Centre for Fighting Economic Crime and Corruption (CFECC) on charges of embezzlement. He had completed his University studies, did not have a criminal record, was employed and had a permanent domicile. 8. On 27 May 2005 the investigating judge of the Buiucani District Court, issued a warrant for his remand in custody for 10 days. The reasons given by the court for issuing the warrant were that: “The criminal proceedings were instituted in accordance with the law in force. [The applicant] is suspected of having committed a serious offence for which the law provides imprisonment of more than two years; the evidence submitted to the court was obtained lawfully; the isolation of the suspect from society is necessary; he could abscond from law-enforcement authorities or the court; he could obstruct the finding of truth in the criminal investigation or re-offend”. 9. The applicant appealed against this decision arguing inter alia that the suspicion against him was groundless, that he did not have any intention of absconding or obstructing the investigation in any way and that he was ready to co-operate with the investigation body. 10. On 1 June 2005, the applicant's appeal was dismissed by a panel of three judges of the Chişinău Court of Appeal. 11. On 3 June 2005 the Buiucani District Court prolonged the applicant's detention on remand for a further 30 days. The court reasoned that detention was necessary because: “[the applicant] is suspected of having committed a very serious offence, there is a risk that he may put pressure on witnesses or put himself out of the reach of law-enforcement authorities; and there is a continuing need to isolate him from society”. 12. The applicant appealed against this decision and submitted the same arguments as advanced in his first appeal. 13. On 9 June 2005 the Chişinău Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal without relying on any new arguments. 14. The applicant's detention on remand was prolonged on the same grounds until 11 October 2005, when he was released from detention. 15. The applicant was detained in the remand centre of the CFECC. The room used for meetings between lawyers and detainees had a glass partition to keep them separated. 16. The relevant domestic law concerning detention on remand was set out in the Court's judgment in Sarban v. Moldova, no. 3456/05, § 52, 4 October 2005. 17. It appears from the photographs submitted by the Government that in the lawyer-client meeting room of the CFECC detention centre, the space for detainees is separated from the rest of the room by a door and a window. The window appears to be made of two plates of glass joined together. Both plates have small holes pierced with a drill; however the holes do not coincide so that nothing can be passed though the window. Moreover, there is a dense green net made either of thin wire or plastic between the glass plates, covering the pierced area of the window. There appears to be no space for passing documents between the lawyer and his client. 18. The domestic courts have ruled on complaints about lack of confidentiality in the CFECC lawyer-client meeting room in the cases of Modârcă (application no. 14437/05) and Sarban (cited above). On 2 November 2004 a judge of the Buiucani District Court ordered the CFECC authorities to remove the glass partition separating lawyers from their clients; however, the CFECC authorities refused to comply with the court order. On 3 December 2004 the same judge revoked the decision of 2 November 2004 arguing that in the meantime she had been informed by the CFECC authorities that there were no recording devices mounted in the wall separating the lawyers from their clients and that the wall was necessary in order to ensure the security of the detainees. On 15 February 2005 Mr Sarban's lawyer complained again to the Buiucani District Court under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention that he could not confer with his client in conditions of confidentiality. On 16 February the same judge from the Buiucani District Court dismissed the complaint without examining it and referred to her previous decision of 3 December 2004. 19. Between 1 and 3 December 2004 the Moldovan Bar Association held a strike, refusing to attend any procedures regarding persons detained in the remand centre of the CFECC until the administration had agreed to provide lawyers with rooms for confidential meetings with their clients. The demands of the Bar Association were refused (see Sarban, cited above, § 126). 20. On 26 March 2005 the Moldovan Bar Association held a meeting at which the President of the Bar Association and another lawyer informed the participants that they had taken part, together with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, in a commission which had inspected the CFECC detention centre. During the inspection they asked that the glass wall be taken down in order to check that there were no listening devices. They pointed out that it would only be necessary to remove several screws and they proposed that all the expenses linked to the verification be covered by the Bar Association. The CFECC administration rejected the proposal. 21. Recommendation Rec(2006)2 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the European Prison Rules (adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 11 January 2006 at the 952nd meeting of the Ministers' Deputies), insofar as relevant, reads as follows: “23.1 All prisoners are entitled to legal advice, and the prison authorities shall provide them with reasonable facilities for gaining access to such advice. ... 23.4 Consultations and other communications including correspondence about legal matters between prisoners and their legal advisers shall be confidential. ... 23.6 Prisoners shall have access to, or be allowed to keep in their possession, documents relating to their legal proceedings.”",1,987
1069,1069,"5. The applicants were born in 1932 and 1934 respectively. The first applicant lives in Mala Moštanica, Serbia, while the second applicant lives in Clamart, France. 6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 7. On 30 January 1986 S.K. filed a real estate claim against the applicants with the Municipal Court in Novi Sad. The value of the dispute (vrednost spora) stated by the plaintiff was 4,000,000 “old dinars”. 8. Following a remittal and a redenomination of the Serbian currency, on 14 December 1998 the Municipal Court ruled in favour of the applicants and noted that the value of the dispute was now 50,000 “new dinars”. 9. Following two remittals, on 28 September 2001 and 17 June 2004 respectively, the Municipal Court twice ruled in favour of the applicants, and on both occasions reaffirmed that the value of the dispute was 50,000 new dinars. 10. On 13 January 2005 the District Court accepted the appeal filed by the plaintiff and, in so doing, ruled partly in his favour. 11. The applicants, who were represented by legal counsel, thereafter filed an appeal on points of law (revizija). 12. On 14 June 2006 the Supreme Court, however, rejected this appeal, stating that the applicants were not entitled to lodge it given that the value of the dispute in question was below 15,000 new dinars, the applicable statutory threshold. In particular, the court acknowledged that the parties had agreed, on 19 November 1998, that the value of the dispute should be 50,000 new dinars, but observed that there was no separate Municipal Court’s decision to this effect in the case file. Therefore, the relevant amount was the 4,000,000 old dinars, as stated in the plaintiff’s original claim, which was clearly less than the 15,000 new dinars threshold under the relevant civil procedure rules (see paragraphs 20 and 21 below). Lastly, implicitly relying on its Opinion of 22 May 2001, the Supreme Court noted that the Government’s Decree of 24 January 1994 had provided that until 22 July 1994 both old and new dinars would be valid legal tender based on the ratio that one new dinar was worth twelve thousand old dinars. The “plaintiff” himself, however, had “not amended the value of the dispute in new dinars” by 22 July 1994 (see paragraph 19 below). 13. The applicants were served with the Supreme Court’s decision on 13 October 2006. 14. Article 382 § 3 provides that an appeal on points of law (revizija) is “not admissible” in pecuniary lawsuits where the value of the dispute, as indicated by the plaintiff in his or her claim, does “not exceed 15,000 ... [new] dinars”, this threshold having been introduced in 1998. 15. However, Article 40 provides, inter alia, that, should the value of the dispute stated by the plaintiff be “obviously too high or too low”, the court itself shall resolve the issue. This must be done, at the latest, at the preliminary hearing or, if one is not held, before the beginning of the main hearing at first instance. 16. Articles 190 §§ 1 and 2 and 191 § 1 provide that a civil claim may, with the consent of the parties, be amended/increased until the conclusion of the main hearing at first instance. 17. Article 392 provides, inter alia, that the Supreme Court shall reject any and all appeals on points of law which it deems inadmissible. 18. Lastly, Articles 383 and 394-397 provide, inter alia, that the Supreme Court shall, should it accept an appeal on points of law lodged by one of the parties concerned, have the power to overturn the impugned judgment or quash it and order a retrial before the lower courts. 19. The Supreme Court opined that where an appeal on points of law would have been available according to the rules in force at the time when the civil claim had been brought, but where, following the redenomination, the value of the dispute in question clearly remained below the threshold of 15,000 new dinars, an appeal on points of law could not be filed. If the parties, however, agreed to amend the value of their dispute so as to raise it above the said threshold by 22 July 1994, at the latest, an appeal on points of law would be admissible (Pravno shvatanje utvrđeno na sednici Građanskog odeljenja Vrhovnog suda Srbije od 22. maja 2001. godine, published in the Supreme Court’s Bulletin no. 1/02). 20. Articles 16 § 3 increased the minimum requirement for an appeal on points of law from 15,000 new dinars to 300,000 new dinars, but specified that, in respect of all suits brought earlier, the applicable amount would still be 15,000 new dinars. 21. The Civil Procedure Act 2004 entered into force on 23 February 2005, thereby repealing the Civil Procedure Act 1977. Article 491 § 4 of the former, however, provides that in all cases which were brought before that date the applicable legislation, as regards an appeal on points of law, shall be the legislation which was in force prior to 23 February 2005. 22. Article 40 §§ 2 and 3 provides, inter alia, that a meeting of a division (sednica odeljenja) of the Supreme Court shall be held if there is an issue as regards the consistency of its case-law. Any opinions (pravna shvatanja) adopted thereupon shall be binding for all panels (veća) of the division in question.",0,907
1070,1070,"The applicant, Mr Jusuf Alibašić, is a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina who was born in 1971 and lives in Goražde. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their Deputy Agent, Ms Z. Ibrahimović. This is the applicant’s second case before the Court. The facts relevant to this case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. Given his history of mental illness, the applicant was deprived of legal capacity and placed under the guardianship of his half sister in 1998. From 21 June 1999 until 16 June 2006 he was detained in Zenica Prison Forensic Psychiatric Annex pursuant to the criminal and mental health legislation. In the applicant’s first case, the Court held that from 1 September 2003 until 16 June 2006 the applicant’s deprivation of liberty had not been “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention as he had been held in psychiatric detention without a decision of the competent civil court (see Tokić and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, nos. 12455/04, 14140/05, 12906/06 and 26028/06, 8 July 2008). He was awarded 15,000 euros for non-pecuniary damage. On 16 June 2006 the Goražde Social Work Centre placed the applicant in Drin Social Care Home and on 20 January 2010 in Duje Social Care Home in accordance with the social care legislation. On 14 September 2010 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina held that the applicant’s deprivation of liberty had not been “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention as he had been held in psychiatric detention without a decision of the competent civil court. It found also that Article 5 § 4 of the Convention had been breached because of lack of judicial review of the lawfulness of the applicant’s detention. On 24 November 2010 the competent civil court finally examined the applicant’s case. It ruled that the applicant could not be held in Duje Social Care Home. The applicant was released on 31 January 2011.",0,349

On 5 September 1997 the applicant instituted civil proceedings before the Slovenska Bistrica Local Court seeking annulment of a purchase contract. 7. On 6 July 1999 the first-instance court annulled the contract. An appeal was lodged. 8. On 24 October 2000 the Maribor Higher Court upheld the appeal and remitted the case for re-examination. 9. Between 12 July 2006 and 15 February 2007 three hearings were held. 10. On 27 February 2007 the applicant withdrew the claim and a decision on termination of proceedings was issued on 21 March 2007. 11.

1072,1072,"8. The applicant was born in 1969 and is currently in Frosinone Prison. 9. On 28 November 1999 the applicant was discovered in possession of a package containing 485 grams of heroin and was arrested by the Rome carabinieri. Proceedings were instituted against him for drug trafficking. On 23 December 1999 the applicant appointed a lawyer of his own choosing, Mr M., who represented him throughout the proceedings. 10. The applicant subsequently requested, through the intermediary of his lawyer, adoption of the summary procedure (giudizio abbreviato) provided for in Articles 438 to 443 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCP”). The representative of the Public Prosecutor’s Office gave a favourable opinion. The Rome preliminary hearings judge, taking the view that the charges against the applicant could be determined on the basis of the steps in the proceedings taken at the preliminary investigation stage (allo stato degli atti) ordered that the summary procedure be adopted. 11. At the private hearing held on 24 March 2000 in the presence of the applicant, the latter, through the intermediary of his lawyer, pleaded not guilty on the ground that the drugs had been intended for his personal use and not for sale. 12. In a judgment of 24 March 2000 the Rome preliminary hearings judge sentenced the applicant to six years’ imprisonment and a fine of 40,000,000 lire (approximately 20,658 euros). He observed that the quantity of drugs permitted for personal use must not exceed what was required to meet immediate needs. At the time of his arrest, the applicant had just purchased a quantity corresponding to more than 8,000 average daily doses. 13. The applicant appealed against the judgment, reiterating the arguments adduced at first instance. He contended that interpreting the law on drugs in a way that penalised drug users was in breach of the Constitution. 14. On 1 September 2000 Mr M. was informed that the hearing had been set down for 3 November 2000. On that day Mr M. objected to the continuation of the proceedings in the absence of his client and requested that the latter be brought from the prison to the hearing room. The Rome Court of Appeal dismissed his request, observing that the applicant had not informed the authorities in advance that he wished to participate in the appeal proceedings. 15. In a judgment of 3 November 2000 the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment at first instance. 16. The applicant appealed on points of law. He alleged that the appeal judges had not allowed him to attend his trial and that the summons to appear at the appeal hearing had not been translated into Arabic. 17. In his final submissions, the public prosecutor requested that the impugned decision be set aside. 18. In a judgment of 24 January 2002 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It observed that neither the Convention nor the CCP required the steps in the proceedings to be translated into the language of a non-national defendant in Italy. However, the latter had the right to be assisted free of charge by an interpreter in order to be able to understand the charges against him and follow the progress of the proceedings. As to the other complaints, the Court of Cassation observed that the presence of the defendant was not required under the summary procedure, the adoption of which had been requested by the applicant himself of his own free will. Furthermore, the applicant had not made clear his wish to participate in the appeal hearing. 19. The summary procedure is governed by Articles 438 to 443 of the CCP. 20. Under the terms of these provisions as they applied at the time when the applicant was arrested, the defendant could request, subject to a favourable opinion from the representative of the Public Prosecutor’s Office, that the case be decided at the preliminary hearing. If the judge deemed that the charges could be determined on the basis of the steps performed at the preliminary investigation stage and recorded in the file held by the Public Prosecutor’s Office (fascicolo del pubblico ministero), he ordered the summary procedure to be adopted. The summary procedure was subsequently amended by Law no. 479 of 16 December 1999. Under the new rules, a favourable opinion from the representative of the Public Prosecutor’s Office is no longer required, and the judge cannot reject the request for the summary procedure to be adopted if the defendant does not request that any evidence be produced (integrazione probatoria). 21. Where the summary procedure is adopted, the hearing takes place in private and is devoted to hearing the arguments of the parties, which must be based on the documents contained in the file held by the Public Prosecutor’s Office. If the judge decides to convict the defendant, the sentence is reduced by onethird (Article 442 § 2). The judgment is delivered in private. 22. Under the terms of Article 597 § 1 of the CCP: “The appeal judge shall be empowered to rule (la congnizione del procedimento) solely (limitatamente) on those aspects of the decision referred to in the grounds of appeal.”",1,853
1076,1076,"4. The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Nagytarcsa, Hungary. 5. On 13 October 1995 the applicant filed for divorce before the Budapest Regional Court. She also claimed custody of the couple's three children, born respectively in 1984, 1986 and 1992, and requested the payment of maintenance and the division of the matrimonial property. 6. After repeated motions for bias filed by the applicant's husband, the Buda Central District Court was first appointed to hear the case. As a consequence of the husband's further motion for bias, the case-file was then transferred to the Zalaegerszeg District Court. 7. On 24 September 1996 the President, the Vice-President and all the judges of the Zalaegerszeg District Court declared bias. 8. On 6 February 1997 the Supreme Court appointed the Miskolc District Court and the Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Regional Court to hear the case. 9. On 2 April 1997 the Miskolc District Court requested the applicant to supplement her action within 8 days. Following the grant of an extension of this time-limit, the applicant submitted additional material on 5 May 1997. 10. A hearing was held on 24 June 1997. 11. On 26 August 1997 the District Court requested the school attended by the couple's children to provide an opinion. It also appointed the Budapest Forensic Medical Expert Institute (“the Institute”) to give an expert psychological opinion on the parties and their children and requested to be advised as to which parent was the more suitable to raise the children. 12. The applicant together with the three children failed to appear at the examinations scheduled for 1 October 1997 as they had not received any notification. 13. The examinations scheduled for 18 November 1997 could not be carried out as the husband and two of the children failed to appear. 14. On 9 December 1997 the Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Regional Court found the husband's renewed motion for bias of 4 September 1997 unsubstantiated. 15. On 12 January 1998 the Miskolc District Court ordered the parties to provide information about the children's situation and the issue of maintenance. 16. In her letters of 15 January and 5 May 1998, the applicant requested the District Court to schedule a hearing in the case and, as an interim measure, to order her husband to pay maintenance. 17. On 25 January 1998 the husband filed a motion for bias against all of the judges of the county. 18. On 5 May 1998 the applicant requested the District Court to deal with the case urgently. On 15 July 1998 she repeatedly requested the court to pronounce the divorce, to grant her custody of the children, to oblige her husband to leave their flat and to pay maintenance. 19. On 26 October 1998 the Supreme Court dismissed the husband's renewed motion for bias and warned him that if he submitted another unsubstantiated motion, he would be fined. 20. At the court's request of 27 November 1998, the applicant provided information about the maintenance of the children. 21. On 14 December 1998 the husband again filed a motion for bias against the judges dealing with the case. 22. On 22 December 1998 the District Court suspended the proceedings pending the outcome of a parallel action to place the husband under guardianship. 23. At the applicant's request, on 6 October 1999 the District Court decided to resume the proceedings and to appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the husband. 24. On 9 November 1999 the applicant elaborated her action and requested the court to obtain psychological and educational opinions on the children. The latter opinion was submitted on 24 November 1999. On 7 December 1999 the Institute appointed an expert psychologist. 25. On 27 January 2000 the parties' two eldest children requested the court to place them, by way of an interim measure, with the applicant. 26. On 3 February 2000 the Institute informed the court that it struck the case out of its list as the husband and the two eldest children had repeatedly failed to appear for the examination. 27. On 8 February 2000 the District Court ordered that the two eldest children be placed with the applicant and obliged the husband to hand them over to her within three days. On 17 February 2000 the husband appealed against this decision. On 23 February 2000 the applicant informed the court that its order could not be executed as the children had in the meantime been placed in a children's home. 28. On 29 June 2000 the Supreme Court dismissed the husband's renewed motion for bias of 7 March 2000. 29. On 26 September 2000 the Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Regional Court quashed the order of 8 February 2000 and remitted the issue of interim measures to the District Court. 30. At the applicant's request, on 29 September 2000 the Miskolc District Court discontinued the proceedings. In her appeal, the applicant requested that the proceedings be resumed and that the case, rather than being discontinued, should be transferred from Miskolc to a court in the town where she was domiciled. On 30 January 2001 the Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Regional Court dismissed her appeal. 31. On 21 July 2001 the applicant renewed her action before the Buda Central District Court. 32. A hearing took place on 15 January 2002 and a further hearing was scheduled for 30 May 2002. 33. At present, the case is pending before the District Court. Article 19 § 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows: “If a party submits a motion for bias, which is manifestly unsubstantiated, or repeatedly submits unsubstantiated motions in the same proceedings in respect of the same judge, the court may, as a provision of the order dismissing the motion, impose a fine on him.”",1,954
1077,1077,"The applicant, Mr Nikola Maksimović, is a Serbian national who was born in 1949 and lives in Lukićevo. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In 2001 the Zrenjanin Municipality Public Prosecutor indicted the applicant for abuse of office. On 31 March 2004 the Zrenjanin Municipal Court found the applicant guilty and imposed a suspended prison sentence (uslovna osuda) of three months. The applicant appealed, claiming that the facts established in the first-instance judgment were incorrect. On 30 June 2004 the Zrenjanin District Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment. On 4 December 2001 the Zrenjanin Municipality Public Prosecutor filed an indictment against Company B. and the applicant in the Zrenjanin Commercial Court for an economic offence concerning the security of payments. Following Serbia’s ratification of the Convention on 3 March 2004, the applicant requested the competent court to stay the proceedings pending the outcome of the aforementioned criminal proceedings (Chapter A above). He claimed that the two proceedings concerned the same amounts of money and thus the same offence. The court stayed the proceedings. On 4 February 2005 the Zrenjanin Commercial Court requested the Zrenjanin Municipal Court to provide a copy of the case file in the other criminal proceedings. However, that court was unable to do so as the file had been sent to the Zrenjanin District Court following the applicant’s request for a reopening of the criminal case and his subsequent appeal against the refusal to do so. Once the proceedings resumed, hearings scheduled for 27 March and 20 April 2006 were adjourned because Company B.’s legal representative had failed to appear. On the last-mentioned date the Zrenjanin Commercial Court fined Company B. for its failure to appear in court. The court held the next hearing on 11 May 2006, when the applicant requested time to set out his defence in writing. The hearing scheduled for 28 September 2006 was again adjourned due to the co-defendant’s failure to appear. The court ordered that the legal representative of Company B. be brought to the next hearing by the police. On 12 October 2006 the Zrenjanin Commercial Court gave judgment acquitting both the applicant and Company B. of all charges.",0,385
1078,1078,"The applicant, Pauli Lella, is a Finnish national, born in 1944 and living in Kehro. At the relevant time the applicant had been politically active for over twenty years, as a member of the Urjala Municipal Assembly and as candidate for Parliament on two occasions. In 1996 he was convicted of aggravated debtor’s dishonesty and a book-keeping offence and sentenced to one year and six months’ imprisonment. The judgment was upheld by a court of appeal and the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen) refused leave to appeal in September 1998. A subsequent request for the case to be re-opened was likewise refused. On 29 September 1998 the Department for Prison Administration of the Ministry of Justice refused the applicant’s request that the enforcement of his sentence be postponed due to his illness. On 19 October 1998 the Urjala Municipal Assembly voted to disqualify the applicant from sitting on the assembly on account of his having been sentenced to over six months’ imprisonment. His appeal was refused by the County Administrative Court (lääninoikeus, länsrätten) of Häme on 11 May 1999. His further appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court (korkein hallinto-oikeus, högsta förvaltningsdomstolen) was apparently likewise refused. Meanwhile, on 29 October 1998, the Chief Enforcement Officer (kihlakunnanvouti, häradsfogden) of Valkeakoski granted the applicant’s further postponement request in order to enable him to organise certain private matters prior to serving his sentence. He was ordered to start serving his prison term on 4 January 1999. In November 1998 the applicant requested that the enforcement of his sentence be postponed until 1 April 1999 so as to allow for his effective participation in the parliamentary elections on 21 March 1999 in which he intended to present himself as a candidate. On 30 November 1998 this request was dismissed, the Chief Enforcement Officer having concluded that the already fixed enforcement would not engender any exceptional and significant losses or difficulties to the applicant, his family, his employer or to society within the meaning of the chapter 2, section 1 (c) of the Act on the Enforcement of Sentences (laki rangaistusten täytäntöönpanosta, lag om verkställighet av straff). Moreover, the considerations militating in favour of the immediate enforcement of his sentence clearly outweighed the inconvenience which such enforcement would cause. Under chapter 2, section 1 (d) of the said Act the decision was automatically referred to the Department for Prison Administration which upheld it on 10 December 1998. Having started to serve his sentence on 4 January 1999, the applicant, on 11 February 1999, filed an extraordinary appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court, seeking to have the refusal quashed as it had been based on a manifestly incorrect application of the law. He also sought to have the enforcement of his sentence stayed at least until the court had decided the matter. On 12 March 1999 the court refused to re-open the case. Meanwhile, on 4 February 1999 the applicant registered as candidate in the upcoming elections. His three requests for leave immediately prior to and on the election day, in order to enable him to complete his campaign, were all refused by the Prison Governor. The refusals were automatically referred to the Department for Prison Administration which upheld them. The applicant was not elected. The sentences imposed on four other defendants convicted in the same criminal proceedings were allegedly not enforced until 1 October 1999. B. Relevant domestic law Parliamentary elections are normally held every four years in Finland. Under the Parliament Act (valtiopäiväjärjestys, riksdagsordning), as in force at the relevant time, anyone entitled to vote in parliamentary elections is likewise entitled to stand as a candidate, unless placed under guardianship (section 7).",0,608
1079,1079,"5. The applicants, mother and son, were born in 1958 and 1981 respectively. The first applicant lives in Ozersk, a closed town in Chelyabinsk Region where the Mayak nuclear fuel reprocessing plant is located and where the second applicant permanently resided before his conviction in 2002. They are joint owners of a flat in Ozersk. The second applicant is currently serving a prison sentence in a correctional colony in Chelyabinsk Region. 6. On 5 August 2002 the second applicant was found guilty at Ozersk Town Court of certain criminal offences and sentenced to four years' imprisonment. 7. On 15 July 2004 the Kasli Town Court, Chelyabinsk Region, relieved him from further serving his sentence. The second applicant returned to Ozersk. 8. The first applicant requested the local administration to authorise the second applicant's entry to, and permanent residence in, Ozersk. It appears the authorities permitted the second applicant's temporary stay in Ozersk from 25 November 2004 to 16 January 2005. 9. On an unspecified date the Ozersk Town Administration (Администрация Озерского городского округа, “the Town Administration”) and the Chelyabinsk Regional Division of the Federal Security Service (Управление федеральной службы безопасности по Челябинской области, “the Regional Security Service”) dismissed the request, referring to the second applicant's conviction. The second applicant challenged the refusal in court. 10. On 21 June 2005 the Ozersk Town Court, Chelyabinsk Region, granted the second applicant's claim. According to the court's findings, the dismissal by the competent authorities of the second applicant's request for the entry to, and permanent residence in, Ozersk did not have a basis in law. The Town Court ordered (1) the Town Administration to issue the second applicant with an entry and residence permit and (2) the Regional Security Service to approve it. 11. The parties did not appeal against the judgment of 21 June 2005 and on 2 July 2005 it came into force. The Town Court issued two writs of execution. 12. On 29 July 2005 the Head of the Town's Administration approved the second applicant's application to be permanently registered in Ozersk. Despite this, on 6 August 2005 the bailiff opened enforcement proceedings in respect of the Town Administration. 13. On 18 August 2005 the administration of the Mayak nuclear fuel reprocessing plant informed the first applicant as follows: “Pursuant to Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation no. 693 as of 11 July 1996 on special regulations in a closed administrative and territorial entity where enterprises affiliated with the Ministry of Nuclear Power are located, on 12 October 2004 the federal security service authorised the temporary residence of [the second applicant] in ... Ozersk. As regards your application for permanent residence [for the second applicant] in [Ozersk], on 3 August 2005 the [Mayak administration] forwarded the [relevant] documents ... to the [Regional Security Service]. The time-limit for their response shall not exceed sixty days. Should the federal security service approve permanent residence [for the second applicant], the [Mayak administration] will prepare the necessary documents for his registration at his place of residence and issuance of a permanent pass.” 14. On 26 August 2005 the bailiff opened enforcement proceedings in respect of the Regional Security Service. 15. According to the Government, on 30 August 2005 the bailiff closed the enforcement proceedings in respect of the Town Administration, noting that the latter had complied with the judgment of 21 June 2005. According to the applicants, the bailiff's decision was not communicated to them. 16. On 5 September 2005 the management of the Mayak nuclear fuel reprocessing plant informed the second applicant that the Regional Security Service had refused to approve him for permanent residence in Ozersk. 17. According to the Government, on 10 October 2005 the bailiff closed the enforcement proceedings in respect of the Regional Security Service, noting that the judgment of 21 June 2005 had been enforced in full. The Government did not, however, submit any documents in support of this allegation. According to the applicants, they were not informed of the alleged closing of the enforcement proceedings. 18. On 13 December 2005 the second applicant was arrested on suspicion of drug dealing. On 16 March 2006 the Ozersk Town Court found him guilty as charged and sentenced him to four years' imprisonment. The second applicant's conviction was upheld in substance by the Presidium of the Chelyabinsk Regional Court by way of supervisory review. 19. The Law of the Russian Federation On Closed Administrative and Territorial Entities of 14 July 1992 (Article 1), as amended, provides as follows: “A closed administrative and territorial entity is a municipality where industrial enterprises specialising in development, production, storage and disposal of mass destruction weapons, processing of radioactive and other materials, military and other facilities... are located. [Such entities] are subject to special regulations on secured operation and protection of state secrets, including special residence conditions.” 20. Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation no. 693 as of 11 July 1996 on special regulations in a closed administrative and territorial entity where enterprises affiliated with the Ministry of Nuclear Power are located stipulates that entry to, and permanent residence in, a closed administrative and territorial entity is subject to restrictions (§ 2). The head of the administration may, subject to the approval of the federal security service, authorise entry to the closed entity (§ 19). Title to real property located in a closed administrative and territorial entity may give rise to a right to enter and reside there, subject to authorisation of access to state secrets (§ 23).",0,917
1080,1080,"The applicant, Mr Timo Lahr, is a German national who was born in 1977 and lives in Welzheim. He was represented before the Court by Ms G. Pahl, a lawyer practising in Hamburg. The applicant is an electrical engineering technician and a member of the National Democratic Party of Germany (Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands, hereafter, “the NPD”). In 1998 he was a local chairperson of that party. The NPD was considered right-wing extremist and populist and was under scrutiny by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and those of various German States (Länder). The NPD has not been declared unconstitutional by the Federal Constitutional Court in accordance with Article 21 § 2 of the Basic Law. On 1 March 1998 the applicant commenced his compulsory military service, which was to end on 31 December 1998. To serve one’s compulsory military service is an obligation imposed by the Basic Law without conferring a right to the conscript to be enlisted. A conscript receives approximately EUR 300 net allowance a month. On 21 April 1998 the applicant’s superior notified the Military Counter-Intelligence Service of his membership of and functions in the NPD. On 1 June 1998 he was appointed as a Private First Class. The applicant performed his duties within the army conscientiously and without any disciplinary reprimand. He did not carry out any political activities within the army. On 27 August 1998 the applicant’s military service was terminated with effect from 31 August 1998. His presence in the army was found to endanger its integrity and order within the meaning of section 29 § 1 No. 6 of the Compulsory Military Service Act (Wehrpflichtgesetz) on account of his membership of and functions in the NPD, a party considered to be right-wing extremist and populist. Moreover, the toleration of an NPD functionary within the army would harm its reputation. On 1 October 1998 the objection he filed was rejected on the ground that his membership of and functions in the NPD were in breach of a soldier’s special duty of loyalty to the Constitution. His membership of and functions in the NPD, a party that pursued unconstitutional aims, manifested his lack of readiness to defend the free democratic order within the meaning of the Basic Law, which posed a danger to military order. On 12 November 2002 the Augsburg Administrative Court rejected a claim lodged by the applicant, finding that the order of 27 August 1998 gave sufficient reasons to consider that his continuing military service would pose a serious danger to military order. Section 29 § 1 No. 6 of the Compulsory Military Service Act gave the authorities no discretion where conduct posing a serious danger to military order was established. Military order within the meaning of that provision embraced the readiness to defence which was guaranteed, inter alia, by the army’s bond to the constitutional order of which it was a guarantor. Relying on the 1998 annual reports on the protection of the Constitution of the Federal Ministry of the Interior and the Bavarian State Ministry of the Interior the court established that at the relevant time the NPD aimed at the – if need be violent – subversion of the democratic order. It referred to several statements by the party leader who pursued the political aim to “install the NPD in absolute power”. Moreover it referred to the speech given by a convicted neo-Nazi at the party congress, who appealed for a “revolution which could not be achieved without blood and victims”. The court found that the above statements by party functionaries had to be attributed to the applicant in his function as a local chairperson at the relevant time. Therefore, his further presence in the German army posed in itself a danger to military order even though his behaviour within the army did not give rise to any complaints. The court clarified that his dismissal did not result in the loss of his rank. On 7 July 2004 the Federal Administrative Court rejected an appeal lodged by the applicant. It endorsed the reasons given by the lower instances and observed that the applicant’s holding of functions in the NPD during his military service was in breach of a soldier’s special duty of loyalty to the Constitution, which was manifested in section 8 of the Soldiers’ Act and was a requisite for the functioning of the army. The NPD’s anti-constitutional attitude, which was expressed by the party leader, had to be attributed to the applicant, who held functions in the party and failed to dissociate himself from those statements. The court referred to the Federal Constitutional Court’s settled case-law that it was not contrary to Article 21 of the Basic Law that the German army drew consequences from the applicant’s membership of a party which had not been declared unconstitutional, as that provision merely protected the political activity of the party members. On 21 January 2005 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit a constitutional complaint by the applicant. It found the arguments given by the lower instances sufficient to justify the termination of his military service, which was therefore in line with the German Constitution and particularly with the prohibition of discrimination. “2. Parties which, through their aims or the conduct of their members, seek to damage or to overthrow the free democratic constitutional system or to endanger the existence of the Federal Republic of Germany shall be held to be anti-constitutional. The Federal Constitutional Court shall determine the question of anti-constitutionality.” §1 [...] Furthermore [military service] shall be terminated, if [...] No.5. based on his previous conduct [the conscript’s] continued presence in the army would pose a serious danger to military order or to the security of the troops, [...] “A soldier must recognise the free democratic order within the meaning of the Basic Law and must act at all times in such a way as to uphold it.”",0,984
1087,1087,"The applicant, Mr Leonid Ivanovich Balyuk, is a Ukrainian national who was born in 1957 and resides in the town of Mukachevo, Zakarpattya Region, Ukraine. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mrs V. Lutkovska and Mr Y. Zaytsev. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In April 2001 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Mukachevo Town Court against Mr S., a private person, seeking recovery of a debt. On 3 May 2001 the court restricted Mr S.’s right to dispose of his property in order to secure the applicant’s claim. However, on 17 May 2001 some of Mr S.’s property (part of an apartment) was sold to Mrs B. On 13 June 2001 the court found for the applicant and awarded him 7,027 Ukrainian hryvnas (UAH) against Mr S. On 23 October 2001 the Zakarpattya Regional Court of Appeal upheld this judgment and it became final. The judgment of 13 June 2001 was not enforced allegedly due to Mr S.’s lack of funds. In December 2001 the applicant instituted proceedings in the same court against Mr S., Mrs B. and the Mukachevo Notary Office No. 1, seeking to invalidate the apartment sales agreement. On 11 February 2002 the court found that the agreement was valid. In particular, the court found that the injunction on the sale of the disputed apartment had only been forwarded to the notary on 17 May 2001 and therefore, at the material time, the notary had acted in good faith. On 27 May 2002 the Supreme Court of Ukraine upheld this judgment. By letters of 24 May and 10 December 2002, the Zakarpattya Regional Prosecutor’s Office informed the applicant that, because of the court’s negligence, the decision of 3 May 2001 had only been received by the Bailiffs’ Service and the notary on 24 May 2001. In March 2002 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Mukachevo Town Court against the Bailiffs’ Service for an allegedly improper enforcement of the judgment of 13 June 2001. On 3 June 2002 the court rejected the applicant’s complaint for having been submitted out of time. On 3 September 2002 the Zakarpattya Appellate Court quashed this decision and remitted the case for a fresh consideration. On 3 December 2002 the court returned the applicant’s complaint without consideration because it did not comply with the procedural requirements prescribed by law. The applicant neither appealed against this decision, nor lodged his complaint anew. On 17 April 2002 the applicant revoked the writ of enforcement and the enforcement proceedings were closed. The applicant states that there was no sense in continuing the enforcement proceedings because the Bailiffs’ Service was inactive and Mr S. had no assets to seize. At the material time Article 156 of the Code provided that a decision to secure a claim should be enforced immediately in accordance with the procedure for the enforcement of judgments.",0,487
1089,1089,"5. The applicant is a company limited by shares with its seat in Budapest. 6. By way of assignments for consideration, done in October 2001 and July 2002, the applicant acquired – through intermediaries – the debts of V. Rt and M. Rt from the Tax Authority. The debts consisted mostly of unpaid payroll taxes and social security contributions and originated in the period before 1998. 7. Since the debtors had become insolvent, the applicant brought an action against the State-owned Hungarian Privatisation and State Holding Company (ÁPV Rt) before the Budapest Regional Court in order to recover the assigned claims. Relying on section 328 of the (Old) Companies Act 1988, it argued that ÁPV Rt – the majority owner of the two debtor companies – bore vicarious liability for the outstanding debts. 8. On 25 September 2003 the Regional Court partly found for the applicant. The court awarded some 47.3 million Hungarian forints (HUF) to the applicant, which corresponded to the debts of V. Rt other than the payroll taxes and social security contributions. It dismissed the action in respect of the latter items. The applicant was obliged to pay HUF 9.6 million to the respondent in legal fees. 9. The applicant appealed. It claimed 22,482,500 Hungarian forints (HUF) plus accrued interest on account of the remaining debts of V. Rt and HUF 177,975,985 plus accrued interest on account of those of M. Rt. 10. The Budapest Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance decision on 9 July 2004. The applicant was obliged to pay HUF 3 million as procedural fees. 11. The applicant lodged a petition for review with the Supreme Court in respect of the social security contributions owed by M. Rt. It submitted that their amount altogether was approximately HUF 160 million – a sum including the principal of HUF 84,515,225 – but susceptible to further taking of evidence in resumed proceedings. 12. On 5 April 2005 the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal's decision. It was satisfied that ÁPV Rt indeed bore vicarious liability in the circumstances. Relying on Uniformity Decision no. 2/2004.PJE, it held however that – pursuant to sections 3(3) and 25(2) of the (Old) Taxation Order Act 1990 – for the impugned social security contributions to be enforceable by the applicant, a decision should have been issued by the Tax Authority establishing the vicarious liability. For want of such a decision, the contributions could not be enforced by the applicant, since the assignment had not conferred any public law powers on it. The applicant was obliged to pay once more HUF 3 million as procedural fee. 13. Section 328 of the (Old) Companies Act 1988 provided as follows: “(1) If [the majority-owner, i.e. controlling] joint-stock company acquires such part of the shares of [the controlled joint-stock company] as exceeding three-fourth of [the latter's] share capital, the board of directors of the controlling ... company ... may give instructions concerning the management of the [controlled] ... company to [its] board of directors, which the latter must carry out (“joint-stock company under direct control”). (2) The controlling ... company shall bear unlimited liability for the debts of the joint-stock company under direct control.” 14. Section 3(3) c) of the (Old) Taxation Order Act 1990 (no. XCI of 1990) (as in force at the material time) provides that the Act is to be applied to the payment of social security contributions. Section 25(2) f) provides that, if a taxpayer fails to pay the tax and it cannot be recovered from that taxpayer, the Tax Authority is entitled to the adoption of a decision establishing vicarious liability to cover the outstanding debt. Sections 6(1) and 6(2), 35(2)f) and 120(1)a) of the (New) Taxation Order Act 2003 (no. XCII of 2003) contain identical rules. 15. The interpretation that assignees cannot claim in civil courts outstanding taxes from those with vicarious liability was upheld by the Supreme Court in Uniformity Decision no. 2/2004.PJE. It considered that, under both Taxation Order Acts, vicarious liability for tax debts was to be established by a decision of the Tax Authority. 16. However, the above legislation was subsequently repealed by Act no. LVI of 2005. According to the reasoning of the bill, the interpretation of the Supreme Court in Uniformity Decision no. 2/2004.PJE – an economically unjustified misconception of the law running counter to the intentions of the lawmaker – rendered unenforceable and thus worthless those tax debts which could not be recovered in the liquidation of the original debtors. Therefore the legal avenue of a civil action was to be opened for the assignees of such claims vis-à-vis those with vicarious liability, so as to restore constitutionality in terms of the right to access to a court in this context.",0,789
1091,1091,"The applicants, Mr Dragoljub Bijelić and Ms Barbara Bijelić, are Croatian citizens, who were born in 1933 and 1942 espectively and live in Karlovac. They are represented before the Court by Mr N. Mamula, a lawyer practising in Karlovac. The respondent Government are represented by their Agents, Ms L. Lukina-Karajković and subsequently by Ms Š. Stažnik. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 25 February 1993 the applicants' house in Turanj, Croatia was blown up by unknown perpetrators. On 17 January 1996 Parliament introduced an amendment to the Civil Obligations Act (“the 1996 Amendment”) which provided that all proceedings concerning actions for damages resulting from terrorist acts were to be stayed pending the enactment of new legislation. The new legislation was to be enacted within six months. On 15 December 2000 the applicants instituted civil proceedings in the Karlovac Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Karlovcu) seeking damages for their destroyed property from the State. At a hearing held on 19 March 2002 the Municipal Court decided to stay the proceedings pursuant to the above legislation. It appears that the court nevertheless continued the proceedings. On 11 October 2002 the Municipal Court gave judgment dismissing the applicants' claim as time barred. Following an appeal, on 14 May 2004 the Karlovac County Court (Županijski sud u Karlovcu) upheld the first instance judgment. The applicants filed a request for revision on points of law and the proceedings still appear to be pending before the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske). Meanwhile, on 14 July 2003 Parliament introduced the Act on Liability for Damage Resulting from Terrorist Acts and Public Demonstrations (“the 2003 Liability Act”). The relevant part of the Civil Obligations Act (Zakon o obveznim odnosima – Official Gazette, nos. 53/91, 73/91, 3/94, 7/96 and 112/99) provided as follows: “Liability for loss caused by death or bodily injury or by damage or destruction of another's property, when it results from acts of violence or terror or from public demonstrations or manifestations, lies with the ... authority whose officers were under a duty, according to the laws in force, to prevent such loss.” The relevant part of the Act Amending the Civil Obligations Act (Zakon o izmjeni Zakona o obveznim odnosima – Official Gazette no. 7/96; “the 1996 Amendment”) reads as follows: “Section 180 of the Civil Obligations Act (the Official Gazette nos. 53/91, 73/91 and 3/94) shall be repealed.” “Proceedings for damages instituted under section 180 of the Civil Obligations Act shall be stayed. The proceedings referred to in sub-section 1 of this section shall be resumed after the enactment of special legislation governing liability for damage resulting from terrorist acts.” The relevant part of section 63 of the Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court (Ustavni zakon o Ustavnom sudu Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette no. 49/02; “the Constitutional Court Act”) reads as follows: “(1) The Constitutional Court shall examine a constitutional complaint even before all legal remedies have been exhausted in cases when a competent court has not decided within a reasonable time a claim concerning the applicant's rights and obligations or a criminal charge against him ... (2) If the constitutional complaint ... under paragraph 1 of this Section is accepted, the Constitutional Court shall determine a time-limit within which a competent court shall decide the case on the merits... (3) In a decision under paragraph 2 of this Article, the Constitutional Court shall fix appropriate compensation for the applicant in respect of the violation found concerning his constitutional rights ... The compensation shall be paid from the State budget within a term of three months from the date when the party lodged a request for its payment.” Article 29 § 1 of the Constitution (Ustav Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette no. 41/01) reads as follows: “In the determination of his rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial court established by law.” The Act on Liability for Damage Resulting from Terrorist Acts and Public Demonstrations (Zakon o odgovornosti za štetu nastalu uslijed terorističkih akata i javnih demonstracija – Official Gazette no. 117/03; “the 2003 Liability Act”) provides that all compensation for damage to property resulting from terrorist acts is to be sought under the Reconstruction Act. Section 10 provides that all proceedings stayed pursuant to the 1996 Amendment are to be resumed. The Reconstruction Act (Zakon o obnovi – Official Gazette nos. 24/96, 54/96, 87/96 and 57/00) provides that the State shall grant reconstruction assistance to the owners of property damaged during the war. Any requests in this respect are to be filed with the competent administrative authority. In its decision no. Rev 86/02-2 the Supreme Court ruled that proceedings concerning damages for terrorist acts, instituted after the 1996 Amendment entered into force, are not to be stayed.",0,813
1092,1092,"The applicant, Mr Massimo Golfetto, is an Italian national, who was born in 1926 and lives in Padua. He is represented before the Court by Mr U. Giuliani Balestrino, a lawyer practising in Milan. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 11 December 1989, 24 November 1990 and 9 April 1991 respectively, the Padua Court declared three companies, allegedly directly or indirectly administered by the applicant, insolvent. In connection with these facts, the applicant was charged on an unspecified date with fraudulent trading and was committed for trial in the Padua Court. At a hearing on 10 February 1995, the presiding judge of the Court of Padua questioned a witness, A.R., who had been the official receiver in the insolvencies of the above-mentioned companies. The presiding judge asked him whether he had been previously involved, as a victim, in criminal proceedings. A.R. answered that he recently had, because someone had fired shots at the door of his house, probably as an act of intimidation. The witness added that the outcome of those proceedings was that the applicant's son had been found guilty and had been sentenced to two years' imprisonment. In fact, the presiding judge of the Court of Padua had also presided over the criminal proceedings against the applicant's son, which had ended on 18 January 1994. On 30 March 1995 the applicant filed a request with the Court of Appeal of Venice for the presiding judge of the Court of Padua to be removed from hearing his case (ricusazione). The grounds for the request were that the presiding judge had stated his opinion on the facts of the case when not exercising his judicial functions (Article 36 para. 1 (c) of the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure) or, in the alternative, that he had stated his opinion on the facts of the case before the end of the proceedings (Article 37 para. 1 (b) of the same Code). On 5 April 1995 the Venice Court of Appeal rejected the applicant's request as manifestly ill-founded. The applicant appealed against that decision to the Court of Cassation. On 9 November 1995 the latter court rejected the applicant's appeal. On 28 December 1995 the Court of Padua found the applicant guilty of fraudulent insolvency and sentenced him to six years' imprisonment and five years' disqualification from civic office. On 9 April 1996 the applicant lodged an appeal against the above decision with the Venice Court of Appeal. When lodging the appeal with the Venice Court of Appeal, the applicant did not explicitly refer to the alleged lack of impartiality of the first-instance judge. Before the Court, he maintains that he did not explicitly raise such a complaint because his request for the judge to be removed had ended with a final decision of the Court of Cassation rejecting it and that, in any event, in Italian law the issue of the alleged partiality of a first-instance judge was not a ground on which the Court of Appeal could set aside a first-instance judgment. According to the latest information provided by the Government, on 4 July 2001 the proceedings in the Court of Appeal were still pending because priority had been accorded to other proceedings. According to the Government, the first hearing should take place at the beginning of 2002.",0,557
1094,1094,"8. On 17 August 1990 the applicant was chosen to be the Mufti of Xanthi by the Muslims who attended prayers at the mosques of that prefectural district. The Greek State appointed another mufti. However, the applicant refused to step down. 9. Fourth sets of criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant under Article 175 of the Criminal Code for having usurped the functions of a minister of a “known religion” on the ground that on 11 February 1996 and 17 February 1996 he had issued and signed messages in the capacity of the Mufti of Xanthi. 10. The applicant was legally represented throughout the proceedings by lawyers of his own choice. The courts heard a number of prosecution and defence witnesses. 11. On 11 December 1997 the single-member first instance criminal court (monomeles plimmeliodikio) of Lamia found him guilty in the three first sets of proceedings on the ground that he had issued and signed messages in the capacity of the Mufti of Xanthi (decisions nos. 3913/1997, 3914/1997, 3915/1997). On 1 December 1999 the single-member first instance criminal court (monomeles plimmeliodikio) of Lamia found the applicant guilty in the fourth set of proceedings on the same ground (decision no. 4919/1999). The applicant appealed. 12. On 31 May 2000 the three-member first instance criminal court (trimeles plimmeliodikio) of Lamia upheld the applicant’s conviction in the four sets of proceedings. It imposed, as a whole, a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment converted into a fine (decisions nos. 1654/2000, 1655/2000, 1656/2000 and 1657/2000). He alleged that these convictions amounted to a violation of Articles 6, 9 and 10 of the Convention. 13. On 8 March 2002 the Court of Cassation rejected the applicant’s appeals concerning the four sets of proceedings. It considered that the offence in Article 175 of the Criminal Code was committed “when somebody appeared as a minister of a known religion and when he discharged the functions of the minister’s office including any of the administrative functions pertaining thereto”. The court considered that the applicant had committed this offence because he behaved and appeared as the Mufti of Xanthi. It further considered that the applicant’s conviction was not contrary to Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention, because the applicant had not been punished for his religious beliefs or for expressing certain views but for usurping the functions of a Mufti. As regards Article 6 of the Convention, the Court of Cassation considered that the applicant was legally represented by lawyers of his own choice throughout the proceedings and that he had exercised all his defence rights (judgment no. 304/2002). 14. The relevant domestic law and practice are set out in the judgment of 17 October 2002 in the case of Agga v. Greece (no. 2), nos. 50776/99 and 52912/99, §§ 33-44.",1,463
1097,1097,"The applicant, Mr Martin Reilly, is a United Kingdom national, born in 1958, and he is currently in prison in Kent. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 8 February 1993 the applicant was convicted on two counts of robbery, one of attempted robbery, one of carrying an imitation firearm and one of using a firearm to resist arrest. He was sentenced to five concurrent sentences amounting to 8 years’ imprisonment. On 4 March 1999 he was convicted of two charges of robbery and two of carrying imitation firearms. He received a life sentence pursuant to section 2 of the Crime Sentencing Act 1997 and his tariff was fixed at 6 years. In sentencing, the judge stated that 12 years would have been the appropriate determinate sentence in his case and referred to the terror experienced by the victims of the robberies and the long-term traumatic effects. The applicant did not seek leave to appeal against sentence. His application for permission to appeal against conviction was refused by the Court of Appeal on 17 October 2000. The 1997 Act came into force on 1 October 1997. Section 2(1) and (2) provide as follows: “(1) This section applies where - (a) a person is convicted of a serious offence committed after the commencement of this section; and (b) at the time when that offence was committed, he was 18 or over and had been convicted in any part of the United Kingdom of another serious offence. (2) The court shall impose a life sentence, that is to say - (a) where the person is 21or over, a sentence of imprisonment for life; (b) where he is under 21, a sentence of custody for life under section 8(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1982, unless the court is of the opinion that there are exceptional circumstances relating to either of the offences or to the offender which justify its not doing so. (3) Where the court does not impose a life sentence, it shall state in open court that it is of that opinion and what the exceptional circumstances are.” Section 2(5) listed the offences considered “serious” for the purposes of the section. The offences listed in section 2(5) were already punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment and they include rape. In this case, decided after the entry into force of the Human Rights Act 1998, the Court of Appeal adopted a more flexible interpretation of the words “exceptional circumstances” in section 2 of the 1997 Act. The appellants contended that section 2 was incompatible with, inter alia, Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention. The Court of Appeal agreed that the manner of interpreting section 2 to date meant that that section could clearly operate in a disproportionate manner, it not being difficult to find examples of situations where it would be wholly disproportionate to impose a life sentence even for a second serious offence. Noting that in the earlier case of Buckland [2000] 1 WLR 1262 an appeal had already been allowed where on the evidence it could not be concluded that the defendant did not present a serious and continuing danger to the public such as could justify the imposition of a life sentence, it considered that the problem would disappear if the words “exceptional circumstances” in section 2 were construed in a manner which accorded with the policy of Parliament in adopting the section. That policy was to protect the public. Accordingly, a finding that an offender does not constitute a significant risk to the public should be considered to constitute “exceptional circumstances” which approach, the Court of Appeal considered, would accord with parliamentary intent and with the provisions of the Convention.",0,624
1098,1098,"The applicant, Mr Norman Barrow, is a British national who was born in 1930 and lives in Stoke-on-Trent. His wife died on 11 October 1985. On 25 June 2000, the applicant applied to the Benefits Agency for the payment of social security benefits. He applied for benefits equivalent to those to which a widow, whose husband had died in similar circumstances to those of his wife, would have been entitled under the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992 (“the 1992 Act”). He was informed that the Benefits Agency was unable to accept his application as a valid claim because the regulations governing the payment of widows' benefits were specific to women. The claim was finally rejected by the Social Security Appeal Tribunal on 14 February 2001. The applicant, Mr Joseph Roberts, is a British national who was born in 1957 and lives in Springfield. His wife died on 7 October 1999, leaving the applicant and his son, born on 2 March 1984. On 21 November 2000, the applicant applied for benefits equivalent to those to which a widow, whose husband had died in similar circumstances to those of his wife, would have been entitled under the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992 (“the 1992 Act”). He was informed on 27 November 2000 that the Benefits Agency was unable to accept his application as a valid claim because the regulations governing the payment of widows' benefits were specific to women. His appeal was dismissed by the Appeal Tribunal on 27 February 2001. The applicant, Mr Michael McConville, is a British national who was born in 1934 and lives in Belfast. He is represented before the Court by Campbell McKee, solicitors. His wife died on 20 June 1985, leaving two children aged 8 and 4. Shortly after her death, the applicant contacted the Department of Health and Social Security by telephone to see whether any widowers' benefits would be available. He was informed that there were no benefits available to him because he was a man. He subsequently made a claim for widowers' benefits equivalent to those to which a widow, whose husband had died in similar circumstances to those of his wife, would have been entitled under the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992 (“the 1992 Act”). He was informed on 5 September 2000 that the Benefits Agency was unable to accept his application as a valid claim because the regulations governing the payment of widows' benefits were specific to women. His appeal to the Social Security Appeal Tribunal was rejected on 9 November 2000. The applicant, John Kelly, is a British national who was born in 1935 and lives in Cheshire. His wife died on 23 September 1998. His claim for widow's benefit was rejected by the Department of Health and Social Security on 8 September 2000 on the ground that, as a man, he was not eligible for the benefits. His appeals to the Appeal Service of the Department were refused in April and July 2001 respectively. The domestic law relevant to these applications is set out in Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, §§ 14-26, ECHR 2002-IV.",0,520
1103,1103,"5. The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Istanbul. 6. The applicant was a civil servant at the Istanbul Municipality. 7. On 22 December 1994 he was arrested by police officers from the Istanbul Security Directorate on suspicion of forgery. He admitted to the charges before the police. 8. On 26 December 1994 the applicant was brought before the investigating judge at the Istanbul Magistrate’s Court, who ordered his detention on remand. 9. On 2 January 1995 the public prosecutor filed an indictment with the Istanbul 7th Criminal Court against the applicant and three co-accused (O.I., M.T. and N.S.), requesting that they be punished for committing forgery under Articles 503 § 1 and 522 of the Criminal Code. The public prosecutor further decided that the Law on the Prosecution of Civil Servants (Memurin Muhakemeti Kanunu) did not apply to this case as the offence was ordinary. 10. On 24 January 1995 the 7th Criminal Court commenced the proceedings. On 3 February 1995 it heard statements from the applicant and two other co-defendants. The applicant denied the charges against him, alleging that his statement in the police station had been extracted from him under duress. At the following hearing on 24 February 1995, the court released the applicant and two co-accused from detention on remand. It further decided to prolong, in absentia, the arrest warrant issued in respect of O.I. as he had absconded. 11. On 10 March 1995 the Istanbul public prosecutor launched an investigation concerning the applicant’s alleged abuse of office in relation to the forgery. During the course of the investigation, the public prosecutor decided that he had no jurisdiction over the case as the applicant was a civil servant. Accordingly, he sent the file to the Istanbul Provincial Administrative Council (İstanbul İl İdare Kurulu), pursuant to the provisions of the Law on the Prosecution of Civil Servants, in order to seek authorisation to prosecute the applicant. 12. On 7 December 1995 the Provincial Administrative Council decided not to authorise the applicant’s prosecution. 13. On 20 January 1998 the Supreme Administrative Court put aside this decision and ordered that the applicant be tried. Subsequently, on 25 March 1998 the public prosecutor filed another indictment with the Istanbul 11th Criminal Court accusing the applicant of abuse of office. 14. On 10 December 1998 the 11th Criminal Court decided to join the case pending before it to the proceedings before the 7th Criminal Court, and sent the case file to the latter. 15. In the course of the proceedings, during the ten hearings held between 5 March 1996 and 3 November 1998, the applicant’s lawyer explicitly asked the court to separate his client’s case from the others and to conclude it. The court each time rejected these requests given the search for O.I., and decided to postpone the hearings, awaiting the outcome of the arrest warrant. In particular, at one of these hearings on 25 November 1997, the applicant’s lawyer informed the court that he had heard that O.I. had escaped abroad. He further stated that his client had been victimised as a result of the prolongation of the proceedings. 16. On 20 May 1999 the court decided that the criminal proceedings concerning O.I. should proceed separately as he could not be found. The same day the court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to ten months’ imprisonment and a fine. The imprisonment was then commuted to a fine and its execution was suspended in accordance with Section 6 of Law no. 647 (the Law on the execution of sentences). 17. Both the applicant and the public prosecutor appealed against the decision, the applicant alleging that there was no concrete evidence on which he could be convicted. 18. On 27 May 2002 the Court of Cassation rejected the reasons for appeal but quashed the judgment on account of a miscalculation of the amount of the fine imposed on the applicant. The Court of Cassation did not order a retrial, but corrected the amount by reducing the fine and upheld the judgment with this amendment.",1,676
1104,1104,"The applicants, Mr Mehmet Dögüş, Ms Ayşe Dögüş, Mr Veysel Dögüş, Ms Saadet Seyhan (Dögüş) and Ms Safiye Dögüş, are Turkish nationals who were born in 1972, 1966, 1976, 1965 and 1944, respectively, and live in Adana. They were represented before the Court by Mr M. Çinkılıç, a lawyer practising in Adana. On 8 February 2001 the applicants' plot of land of 652 m² located in the Yüreğir district of Adana was expropriated by a decision of the Adana Governor's office for the construction of a school. The applicants were paid 10,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL) per square metre of their land as compensation. On 1 May 2001 the applicants brought an action before the Adana Civil Court for additional compensation. On 20 November 2001 the Adana Civil Court partially granted the applicants' request after having obtained two expert reports on the value of the land. On 29 April 2002 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the Adana Civil Court and remitted the case to that court for a revaluation of the land. On 23 January 2003 the Adana Civil Court partially granted the applicants' request in the light of additional expert reports. On 15 April 2003 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the Adana Civil Court once again due to the lack of clarity of the expert reports and requested the revaluation of the land. On 28 October 2003 the Adana Civil Court awarded the applicants additional compensation of TRL 4,171,940,000 on the basis of additional expert reports, plus interest at the statutory rate, running from 10 April 2001. On 29 March 2004 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court. On 2 July 2004 the administration paid the applicants TRL 13,826,638,792 in additional compensation, together with interest.",0,295
1115,1115,"The applicant, Mr Ayodeji Yesufa, is a Nigerian national who was born in 1984. He currently lives in Nigeria. He was represented before the Court by Doves Solicitors, a firm of solicitors practising in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr D. Walton of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. The applicant and his brother arrived in the United Kingdom in 1987 to join their father, who was resident there, and their sister, who was born in the United Kingdom and was a British citizen. When the applicant’s father died in 1995 his mother came to the United Kingdom to care for him. On 14 August 2000 the applicant was granted Indefinite Leave to Remain as a dependant of his mother. Shortly after the death of his father, the applicant began to mix with older children and he started to commit criminal offences. When he was approximately twelve years old he was expelled from school. Between August 1998 and September 2003 he accumulated twenty-six criminal convictions arising from fifteen sentencing hearings for offences including criminal damage, driving whilst uninsured, receiving stolen goods, possession of a Class B drug (cannabis), common assault and burglary. The maximum sentence that he received was a twelve month detention and training order. On 14 December 2004 the applicant was convicted of robbery. On 19 January 2005 was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. In two separate incidents the applicant and a number of accomplices had stolen GBP 80 and some alcoholic beverages from an off-licence and four items of jewellery from a pawn brokers. During the second incident the applicant and his accomplices were armed with iron bars. On 30 January 2006 the Secretary of State for the Home Department wrote to the applicant asking him to submit reasons why he should not be deported following his conviction on 14 December 2004. His representations were considered but the Secretary of State concluded that his deportation would be conducive to the public good. That decision was issued to the applicant on 18 February 2006. He appealed to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (“AIT”). On 26 April 2006 the Immigration Judge dismissed the appeal, holding, inter alia, that the decision appealed against would not cause the United Kingdom to be in breach of the law or its obligations under the Convention as the applicant did not enjoy family life in the United Kingdom and there were no insurmountable obstacles to his mother and brother returning to Nigeria with him. The AIT found no error of law in the Immigration Judge’s decision and refused to make an order for reconsideration. In an undated decision the Administrative Court ordered the AIT to reconsider the Immigration Judge’s decision on the ground that the judge had erred in law in finding that the applicant’s family could be expected to return to Nigeria with him. On reconsideration, the AIT accepted that the applicant had established both family and private life in the United Kingdom but held that any interference was not a disproportionate exercise of the Secretary of State’s discretion to make a deportation order. On 8 August 2007 the AIT refused to grant the applicant leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. The applicant was released on licence on 5 January 2007. He subsequently was convicted of a further eight offences, including carrying a lock knife in a public place, breaching bail conditions, possession of a Class A drug and motoring offences. On 22 October 2008 the applicant was deported to Nigeria. On 15 September 2009 the applicant indicated for the first time that he had been in a ten-year relationship with a British citizen, who had given birth to their child on 7 June 2009. Sections 1(4) and 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971 provide for the making of Immigration Rules by the Secretary of State. Section 3(5)(a) of the same Act (as amended by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999) provides that a person who is not a British citizen shall be liable to deportation from the United Kingdom if the Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good. Sections 82(1) and 84(1)(a) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 provide for a right of appeal against a decision to deport, inter alia, on the grounds that the decision is incompatible with the Convention and that it was not in accordance with the Immigration Rules. The Rules relating to the revocation of a deportation order are contained in paragraphs 390 and 391 of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended), supplemented by Chapter 13 of the Immigration Directorate’s Instructions (“IDIs”). There is no specific period after which revocation will be appropriate although Chapter 13 of the IDIs gives broad guidelines on the length of time deportation orders should remain in force after removal. Cases which will normally be appropriate for revocation three years after deportation include those of overstayers and persons who failed to observe a condition attached to their leave, persons who obtained leave by deception, and family members deported under section 3(5)(b) of the Immigration Act 1971. With regard to criminal conviction cases, the normal course of action will be to grant an application for revocation where the decision to deport was founded on a criminal conviction which is now “spent” under section 7(3) of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. Paragraph 391 of the Rules, however, indicates that in the case of an applicant with a serious criminal record continued exclusion for a long term of years will normally be the proper course. This is expanded on in Annex A to Chapter 13 of the IDIs, which indicates that revocation will not normally be appropriate until at least 10 years after departure for those convicted of serious offences such as violence against the person, sexual offences, burglary, robbery or theft, and other offences such as forgery and drug trafficking.",0,999

On 17 November 1982 a public company, the Türkiye Süt Endüstrisi Kurumu (the State dairy producer, hereafter referred to as the “SEK”), decided to partially expropriate a plot of land (parcel no. 80) owned by the applicant company and located in Mersinli, İzmir. On 25 February 1983 the applicant company was officially notified of the SEK's expropriation decision by a notice served through the notary public. It was indicated in the notice that expropriation compensation in the amount of 2,803,700 Turkish liras (TRL) had been deposited in the applicant company's name in a blocked bank account at the Alsancak Branch of Ziraat Bankası, a State-run bank. The applicant subsequently sought the annulment of the expropriation. On 21 December 1983 the İzmir Administrative Court rejected the applicant's request and on 18 December 1984 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the administrative court's decision. On an unspecified date the applicant company commenced proceedings for additional compensation. On 4 November 1986 the İzmir Civil Court ordered that the amount of compensation be increased by TRL 7,848,800. The judgment became final on 17 February 1987, neither of the parties having appealed. On 25 November 1987 the additional expropriation was deposited in the same account at Ziraat Bankası in the applicant company's name. The applicant company subsequently lodged an action with the İzmir Administrative Court for the annulment of the parcel plan pertaining to the expropriated plot of land. On 27 April 1988 the İzmir Administrative Court annulled the parcel plan as requested. On 29 May 1989 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the administrative court. A new parcel plan was prepared on 24 September 1998, which was also annulled by the İzmir Administrative Court on 18 October 2002. It appears that there is presently no parcel plan in respect of the land in question. On 3 December 1987 the SEK commenced proceedings before the İzmir Civil Court for the compulsory registration of the title of the expropriated land in its name. Following proceedings which lasted for ten years and involved six examinations, on 1 April 1997 the Court of Cassation granted the suit. On 2 July 1997 it rejected the applicant company's rectification request. The Court of Cassation held that the pending parcel plan pertaining to the relevant land did not preclude the registration of its title in the expropriating company's name. In the meantime, on 6 March 1992 the applicant company lodged an action for recovery of the expropriated land in accordance with Article 23 of the now defunct Expropriation Law (Law No. 6830). They argued that the public interest justifying expropriation in the present case had been lost as the land had not been put to use in accordance with the initial purpose of the measure. On 30 October 1996 İzmir Civil Court dismissed the applicant's request, holding that the conditions for restitution of expropriated land under Article 23 of the said Law had not materialised. On 4 April 1997 the Court of Cassation upheld this judgment and on 4 June 1997 it rejected the applicant company's rectification request. On 11 November 1997 the SEK was merged with another public company, thereby losing its legal personality. Upon this merger, on 11 February 1998 the applicant company applied for the reopening of the proceedings concerning the recovery and the compulsory registration of the land. They argued that the land was no longer required for public purposes as the expropriating public company had ceased to exist. On 21 December 1999 the İzmir Civil Court rejected the applicant's request by two separate judgments (cases nos. 1996/529 E. and 1996/530 E.), holding that the conditions for reopening the proceedings had not been satisfied. According to the information in the case file, both judgments became final on 19 October 2000. On 7 June 2000 the applicant company sent a letter to Ziraat Bankası to inquire whether the expropriation compensation, together with the additional amount, had been deposited with the bank and, in the affirmative, whether they were entitled to have access to the money. On 26 July 2000 they sent another letter to the bank, requesting it to expedite the reply. It is alleged that the bank never sent a written reply but orally informed the applicant company that they had no records regarding the requested information. The applicant company accordingly brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment (tespit davası) on 15 April 2002 before the İzmir Civil Court to establish whether the expropriation compensation had been deposited in a blocked account at Ziraat Bankası in its name or whether any payment had been otherwise made to it in compensation for the expropriation. The bank verified during the proceedings that the expropriation compensation had been deposited in a blocked account in the applicant company's name at their Alsancak Branch, but no attempt had been made to collect it. On 19 September 2002 the firstinstance court dismissed the applicant company's case, as the statements received from the bank had made it unnecessary to render a declaratory judgment. On 8 April 2003 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court and on 27 June 2003 it rejected the rectification request.",0,913
1119,1119,"4. The applicant was born in 1985 and lives in Izmir. 5. On 27 December 2001 the applicant, who was sixteen years old at the time, was arrested by police officers from the Karşıyaka Police Station in connection with an ongoing investigation concerning a robbery that had taken place in a primary school. In his police statement, the applicant confessed that he had been involved in a robbery on 26 November 2001 together with two of his friends. He explained that he had helped his friends in carrying a computer from the primary school. The same day he was brought before the public prosecutor, and the investigating judge at the Karşıyaka Magistrate’s Court, where he repeated his statement to the police. Having regard to the evidence in the file and considering that there was a risk of absconding, the investigating judge ordered that the applicant be detained on remand in a prison together with adults. 6. The applicant’s representative challenged this decision before the Karşıyaka Criminal Court and maintained that the evidence in the file did not suffice to keep her client in detention. Invoking Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention, she requested that the applicant be released. 7. On 10 January 2002 the Karşıyaka public prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant in the Karşıyaka Criminal Court. He charged him with robbery under Article 493 of the Criminal Code. 8. On 14 January 2002 the Karşıyaka Criminal Court commenced the trial against the applicant. Taking into account the seriousness of the offence and the evidence in the case-file, it ordered that the applicant’s detention on remand be continued. 9. On 16 January 2002 the applicant’s representative challenged this decision. She invoked Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention and alleged that there was not sufficient evidence in the file to keep her client in detention. She further maintained that pursuant to Article 104 of the Criminal Procedure Code, a person could only be held in detention on remand if there were a risk of absconding and/or of tampering with evidence. She stated that the authorities knew where the applicant lived and there were no sufficient grounds to believe that the applicant would try to flee. Furthermore, according to the lawyer, as all the evidence relating to the case had already been gathered by the authorities, there was no risk of tampering with evidence. 10. On 30 January 2002 the Karşıyaka Assize Court refused the applicant’s request for release basing itself on the nature and seriousness of the accusation, and the evidence in the file. 11. During the hearing which was held on 8 February 2002, the Karşıyaka Assize Court heard the applicant’s testimony. Before the court, the applicant denied the charges and stated that he had not been involved in the robbery. Underlining that the applicant was a minor, the representative of the applicant asked the court for his release. Having regard to the nature of the crime, and taking into consideration the time spent in detention, the court decided that the applicant’s detention should be continued. 12. On 7 March 2002 the applicant’s representative asked the Karşıyaka Criminal Court to release her client. She maintained that he had been in detention since 27 December 2002 and stated that there was no sufficient evidence to keep him in detention. The court once again refused her request. 13. On 28 March 2002 the applicant’s representative further requested her client’s release referring to Article 5 of the Convention. She stated that the court was not examining their requests for release thoroughly. She contended that the applicant’s release would not in any way pose a danger to public order. She also stated that the applicant was ready give a guarantee to offset any risk of absconding. 14. On 29 March 2002 the Karşıyaka Criminal Court dismissed the applicant’s request relying on the evidence in the file and the seriousness of the offence. 15. On 5 April 2002 the Karşıyaka Criminal Court held another hearing, at the end of which it ordered that the applicant remain in detention on remand. 16. On 9 April 2002 the applicant’s lawyer challenged this decision before the Karşıyaka Assize Court. She maintained that her client was a minor and could not be kept in detention for such a long time. In this respect, she invoked Article 5 of the Convention and Article 37 (b) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. 17. On 10 April 2002 the Karşıyaka Assize Court rejected the request for release basing itself on the evidence in the file, the time spent in detention and the nature of the offence. 18. On 1 May 2002, after spending almost four months in detention on remand, the applicant was released pending trial. 19. The proceedings against the applicant are still pending.",1,801
1129,1129,"4. The applicant was born in 1936 and resides in the town of Novogrodivka, Donetsk region, Ukraine. 5. The applicant instituted proceedings in the Novogrodivskyy Town Court of Donetsk Region against the Novogrodivska Mining Company No. 1/3 (Шахта 1/3 «Новогродівська») - a State-owned enterprise - to recover salary arrears and other payments due to her late husband. 6. On 28 May 2001 the Novogrodivskyy Town Court found in favour of the applicant (Рішення Новогродівського міського суду Донецької області) and awarded her 23,741.84 Ukrainian hryvnias (“UAH”). The judgment was sent for enforcement to the Novogrodivskyy Town Bailiffs' Service (Відділ Державної виконавчої служби Новогродівського міського управління юстиції). 7. Subsequently, the applicant instituted proceedings in the Novogrodivskyy Town Court of the Donetsk Region against the Novogrodivskyy Town Bailiffs' Service for failure to enforce the judgment in her favour. On 20 December 2001 the Town Court rejected the applicant's claim, finding no fault had been committed by the Bailiffs' Service. The court stated that the Bailiffs' Service had acted properly in enforcing the judgment of 28 May 2001. However, by a number of decisions of the Commercial Court of the Donetsk Region, the Bailiffs' Service had been prohibited from selling the property of the Mining Company, due to the bankruptcy proceedings which had been initiated against the company. On 14 March 2002 the Supreme Court of Ukraine rejected the applicant's appeal in cassation. 8. In August 2002, the applicant instituted another set of proceedings in the Novogrodivskyy Town Court of the Donetsk Region against the Novogrodivskyy Town Bailiffs' Service for failure to enforce the judgment in her favour. On 10 October 2002 the Town Court rejected the applicant's claim, for the same reasons as before. On 16 December 2002 the Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the first instance court of 10 October 2002. On 22 October 2003 the Supreme Court of Ukraine rejected the applicant's appeal in cassation. 9. In February 2003 the Novogrodivska Mining Company was reorganised and became a structural subdivision of the Selidovugol Mining Company. As the latter thereby became the debtor, in February 2004 the enforcement proceedings were transferred to the Selidivskyy Town Bailiffs' Service (Відділ Державної виконавчої служби Селидівського міського управління юстиції). 10. The judgment in the applicant's favour was enforced by instalments, the last amount being paid on 31 August 2004. 11. The applicant instituted proceedings in the Selidivskyy Town Court of the Donetsk region against the Selidivskyy Town Bailiffs' Service claiming compensation for material and moral damage caused to her by the delay in the enforcement of the judgment in her favour. On 24 November 2004 the court found against the applicant. On 21 July 2005 the Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal upheld this judgment. The applicant appealed in cassation and the proceedings are still pending. 12. The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Sokur v.

Zaytsev, their Agent, and Mrs I. Shevchuk, Head of the Office of the Government Agent before the European Court of Human Rights. In July 1994 the applicant deposited 1,000,000 karbovantsi (around 30 ECU in the Ukrainian transitional currency) with the private commercial bank “Privatbank” (the “Bank”; Комерційний банк “Приватбанк”) for a four-year term at an annual interest rate of 500%. At the end of the contract, the Bank paid the applicant 182 Ukrainian hryvnyas (about 0.70 ECU), referring to the introduction of the new hryvnya currency and a revision of interest rates as allowed by the contract between the parties. On 30 September 1998 the applicant instituted civil proceedings in the Leninsky District Court of Lugansk (the “District Court”; Ленінський районний суд м. Луганська) seeking higher payment and damages. Subsequently, she amended her claims on one occasion. On 18 November 1998 the District Court ordered a financial expert assessment, which was received on 16 February 1999. On 18 March 1999 the District Court held a hearing and dismissed the applicant’s claims, finding that the Bank had acted in compliance with applicable law and the contract between the parties. The judgment became final. Unsatisfied with the outcome of her litigation, the applicant requested the authorities to re-open the proceedings by way of lodging a supervisory protest. On 19 April 2000 the Presidium of the Lugansk Regional Court (the “Regional Court;” Луганський обласний суд) quashed the judgment of 18 March 1999 following a protest introduced by its President and remitted the case for a fresh consideration to the District Court. Between July and December 2000 the District Court held three hearings. On 14 December 2000 the District Court allowed the applicant’s amended claims, finding that the Bank had breached the contract. The Bank appealed in cassation. On 22 January 2001 the Regional Court upheld the judgment of 14 December 2000 and it became final. The Bank requested to re-open the proceedings by way of supervisory review. On 28 February 2001 the Presidium of the Regional Court quashed the rulings of 14 December 2000 and 22 January 2001 following a protest lodged by its President and remitted the case to the District Court for a fresh consideration. Between May and July 2001 the District Court scheduled three hearings, one of them being adjourned on account of the defendant’s absence. On 3 July 2001 the District Court dismissed the applicant’s claims. The applicant appealed. On 3 September 2001 the Regional Court upheld this judgment on appeal. The applicant appealed in cassation. On 23 April 2003 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal in cassation.",0,454
1137,1137,"The applicant, Mr Ioan Kornelij Komanický, is a Slovakian national who was born in 1943 and lives in Bardejov. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. On 4 June 2002 the European Court of Human Rights delivered its judgment in application No. 32106/96 filed by the applicant. The case related to the alleged unfairness of domestic proceedings concerning the lawfulness of the applicant's dismissal from a job in which the final decision had been given on 6 March 1996. In its judgment the Court found that (i) there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the procedure followed by the national courts when examining the applicant's action, (ii) that it was not necessary to examine separately the applicant's complaint under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the dismissal of his action had been arbitrary and (iii) that it was not necessary to rule on the complaint under Article 13 of the Convention. The Court obliged the respondent State to pay the applicant EUR 1,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage and EUR 100 in respect of costs and expenses. The Court's judgment became final on 4 September 2002. Subsequently the respondent Government paid the sum due to the applicant. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has not yet concluded its examination of issues relating to the execution of that judgment. On 28 October 2002 the applicant filed a complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution. He claimed that the Constitutional Court should quash the ordinary courts' decisions relating to his dismissal from a job as the Court had found the relevant proceedings to be contrary to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. Subsequently the applicant also requested that his dismissal should be declared void and that a job corresponding to his previous position should be offered to him. He also claimed 200,000 Slovakian korunas as just satisfaction. On 12 March 2003 the Constitutional Court rejected the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. It held that the Constitutional Court Act contained no provision permitting to examine the legal consequences of a judgment delivered by the European Court of Human Rights concluding that a person's rights under the Convention had been violated by Slovakian authorities or to re-open the relevant domestic proceedings on the basis of such a finding. In the absence of any legal basis, a complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution could not serve as a means of ensuring re-examination of a case in which a final decision had been given notwithstanding the European Court's finding that the domestic courts had in such proceedings violated the human rights of the person concerned. The decision was taken in camera and it indicated that it was adopted by the First Chamber of the Constitutional Court. It was signed by the president of that chamber. Article 127 of the Constitution, as in force since 1 January 2002, reads as follows: “1. The Constitutional Court shall decide on complaints lodged by natural or legal persons alleging a violation of their fundamental rights or freedoms or of human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in international treaties ratified by the Slovak Republic ... unless the protection of such rights and freedoms falls within the jurisdiction of a different court. 2. When the Constitutional Court finds that a complaint is justified, it shall deliver a decision stating that a person's rights or freedoms set out in paragraph 1 were violated as a result of a final decision, by a particular measure or by means of other interference. It shall quash such a decision, measure or other interference. When the violation found is the result of the failure to act, the Constitutional Court may order that [the authority] which violated such rights or freedoms should take the necessary action. At the same time the Constitutional Court may return the case to the authority concerned for further proceedings, order that such an authority abstain from violating fundamental rights and freedoms ... or, where appropriate, order that those who violated the rights or freedoms set out in paragraph 1 restore the situation existing prior to the violation. 3. In its decision on a complaint the Constitutional Court may grant adequate financial satisfaction to the person whose rights under paragraph 1 were violated.” ... Under Article 228(1), a party to civil proceedings can challenge a final decision by means of a request for re-opening of the proceedings where (i) facts, decisions or proofs exist which, for reasons beyond his or her control, the party was unable to use in the original proceedings provided that they can bring about a more favourable decision for such a party, (ii) evidence can be taken which could not be taken in the original proceedings provided that this can result in a more favourable decision for the party concerned and (iii) the decision against a party was given in the context of a criminal offence committed by a judge. Article 230(1) provides that a request for re-opening of proceedings is to be filed within 3 months from the moment when the party concerned learned or could have availed himself/herself of the reason for the request. Under paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 230, a request for re-opening of proceedings cannot be filed more than 3 years from the final effect of the decision in question with the exception of cases where a civil court granted a right to a person on the basis of a criminal court's judgment and where such a judgment was subsequently quashed in accordance with the criminal law.",0,937
1141,1141,"The applicant is a Turkish national, born in 1965 and living in Turkey. He is represented before the Court by Mr L. Weh, a lawyer practising in Bregenz. A. In November 1991 the applicant arrived in Austria. On 1 June 1992 he married an Austrian citizen. Subsequently he requested a work permit and a residence permit. In June 1992 he was given a work permit. The residence permit, however, was refused. On 12 August 1993 the Bregenz District Administrative Authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft) issued a deportation order (Ausweisungsbescheid) against the applicant. It found that the applicant had no residence permit and that his stay in Austria was therefore unlawful. Thus, his removal from Austria was necessary in the public interest. The applicant, assisted by counsel, instituted appeal proceedings, which were terminated in April 1994 by the decision of the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof) which found that the deportation order was lawful. These proceedings were the issue of Application No. 25050/94 which was declared inadmissible by the European Commission of Human Rights on 16 January 1996. On 11 May 1994 the District Administrative Authority ordered the applicant to leave Austria. On the basis of the deportation order, the applicant was arrested in October 1994. On 12 October 1994 the applicant, assisted by lawyer, appealed to the Vorarlberg Independent Administrative Panel (Unabhängiger Verwaltungssenat) against his detention with a view to expulsion. He argued that his detention was not necessary because five months had already elapsed since the Authority’s order to leave Austria in May 1994. Besides, the Administrative Court’s decision of April 1994 was no longer enforceable for lapse of time. Furthermore, he requested the resumption of the expulsion proceedings and a hearing before the Independent Administrative Panel. On 18 October 1994, having taken into account the case-file and the Administrative Authority’s comments on the applicant’s appeal (Gegenschrift), the Independent Administrative Panel dismissed the appeal and upheld the applicant’s detention. It found that it was not competent to review the lawfulness of the underlying deportation order. It noted that the Administrative Court had found that the measure was lawful and that the applicant had been ordered to leave Austria on several occasions, but had not complied. He had been lawfully detained with a view to enforcing the expulsion, in accordance with Section 41 of the Aliens Act (Fremdengesetz). It noted further that the applicant was mistaken when arguing that the deportation order was no longer enforceable. Finally, it found that no hearing was necessary because the factual basis was clear from the file. On 29 November 1994 the applicant filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof). He argued that his detention was not necessary and that the Independent Administrative Panel had violated Article 5 § 4 of the Convention as it had not held a hearing and had not communicated the District Authority’s comments on his appeal. On 28 February 1995 the Constitutional Court refused to deal with the case and transferred it to the Administrative Court. It found that Article 5 § 4 of the Convention did not guarantee a public hearing, and that access to the file as well as the submission of any further observations had been possible for the applicant throughout the proceedings. On 10 October 1995 the Administrative Court dismissed the complaint. It found that the detention with a view to expulsion had been necessary. As to a hearing, access to the file and the possibility to submit further information, it agreed with the Constitutional Court. The Administrative Court’s decision was served upon the applicant on 27 December 1995. B. Relevant domestic law Section 41 of the Aliens Act 1992 (Fremdengesetz), applicable at the material time, allows the arrest and detention of an alien if these measures are necessary to ensure, inter alia, expulsion. The detainee must be released as soon as the grounds for detention cease to exist. The maximum period of detention is limited to two months (Section 48). Everyone arrested and detained under the Aliens Act has the right to apply to the competent Independent Administrative Panel and to challenge the lawfulness of the arrest and the detention order (Section 51 § 1). An appeal may be filed either directly with the Independent Administrative Panel or with the authority of first instance. In the latter case this authority has to present the appeal to the Independent Administrative Panel within a maximum delay of two days (Section 51 § 2). Besides, the detaining authority has to inform the Panel immediately in case of the applicant’s release (Section 51 § 3). If the detainee, however, is not released before, the Independent Administrative Panel has to decide on the continuation of the detention within one week (Section 52 § 2). Section 17 of the General Administrative Procedure Act (Allgemeines Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz) provides for the right to inspect the case-files. This section is applicable to proceedings concerning the review of an arrest or a detention with a view to expulsion.",0,819

On 26 September 1991 the applicant lodged a claim for a higher amount of sickness benefit with the Wrocław Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki we Wrocławiu). On 18 November 1999 the Wrocław Regional Court issued a relevant judgment. The enforcement proceedings were terminated on 31 December 2001. On 26 January 2000, the date on which the application was lodged with the Court, the enforcement proceedings were pending before the Głogów District Court.

It lays down various legal means designed to counteract and/or redress the undue length of judicial proceedings. Section 2 of the 2004 Act reads, in so far as relevant: Section 5 reads, in so far as relevant: “1. A complaint about the unreasonable length of proceedings shall be lodged while the proceedings are pending. ...” Section 12 provides for measures that may be applied by the court dealing with the complaint. It reads, in so far as relevant: “1. The court shall dismiss a complaint which is unjustified. 2. If the court considers that the complaint is justified, it shall find that there was an unreasonable delay in the impugned proceedings. 3. At the request of the complainant, the court may instruct the court examining the merits of the case to take certain measures within a fixed time-limit. Such instructions shall not concern the factual and legal assessment of the case. 4. If the complaint is justified the court may, at the request of the complainant, grant ... just satisfaction in an amount not exceeding PLN 10,000 to be paid by the State Treasury. If such just satisfaction is granted it shall be paid out of the budget of the court which conducted the delayed proceedings.” Section 18 lays down transitional rules in relation to the applications already pending before the Court. It reads, in so far as relevant: “1. Within six months after the date of entry into force of this law persons who, before that date, had lodged a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights ... complaining of a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time guaranteed by Article 6 (1) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ..., may lodge a complaint about the unreasonable length of the proceedings on the basis of the provisions of this law if their complaint to the Court had been lodged in the course of the impugned proceedings and if the Court has not adopted a decision concerning the admissibility of their case. ...” On 18 January 2005 Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) adopted a resolution (no. III SPP 113/04) in which it ruled that while the 2004 Act produced legal effects as from the date of its date of entry into force (17 September 2004), its provisions applied retroactively to all proceedings in which delays had occurred before that date and had not yet been remedied.",0,557

On 30 December 2004 the Varaždin State Attorney’s Office (Općinsko državno odvjetništvo Varaždin) indicted the applicant before the Varaždin Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Varaždinu) for threatening behaviour. The applicant chose to defend himself in person and had no legal representation in the proceedings before the trial court.

At the beginning of a hearing scheduled for 8 September 2005 at 12.30 p.m., the applicant’s wife approached the presiding judge asking on the applicant’s behalf for an adjournment of the hearing. She presented medical evidence showing that on 4 September 2005 the applicant had been injured and could not walk. The judge, however, continued with the hearing at which three witnesses, all of whom were called on behalf of the prosecution, gave evidence. The prosecution also gave their closing arguments and the trial was concluded. The applicant was found guilty as charged and sentenced to three months’ imprisonment. On 4 October 2005 the applicant, now legally represented, lodged an appeal whereby he argued that the impugned judgment had not been adequately reasoned, that the reasons given by the trial court had been contradictory and that the facts had been wrongly established. The appeal was dismissed and the first-instance judgment upheld by the Varaždin County Court (Županijski sud u Varaždinu) on 2 November 2005. On 30 December 2005 the applicant lodged a request for an extraordinary review of a final judgment (zahtjev za izvanredno preispitivanje pravomoćne presude). It was dismissed by the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Repbulike Hrvatske) on 9 March 2006 on the ground that the applicant had failed to specify any ground for lodging his request under the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Instead, he had challenged only the findings of the lower courts as to the facts of the case, which was not a ground for a request for extraordinary review of a final judgment. On 16 October 2006 the applicant asked the Varaždin State Attorney’s Office to lodge a request for the protection of legality with the Supreme Court. This was denied on 11 July 2007. The relevant part of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Zakon o kaznenom postupku, Official Gazette nos. 110/1997, 27/1998, 58/1999, 112/1999, 58/2002, 143/2002 and 62/2003) provides as follows: “(1) Where a law has been infringed, the State Attorney of the Republic of Croatia may lodge a request for the protection of legality against final court decisions and against the court proceedings preceding such decisions. (2) The State Attorney of the Republic of Croatia shall lodge a request for the protection of legality against a court decision adopted in proceedings which violated fundamental human rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Constitution, laws or international law. ...” Article 419 of the Serbian Criminal Procedure Code (Zakonik o krivičnom postupku, published in Official Gazette nos. 70/01 and 68/02) reads: “Where a law has been infringed, the competent State Attorney may lodge a request for the protection of legality against final court decisions and against the court proceedings preceding such decisions.”",0,574

1152,1152,"4. The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Leicester. 5. His wife died on 16 February 1996, leaving two children of ten and twelve years of age respectively. His claim for widows’ benefits was made on 9 February 1997 and was rejected on 18 February 1997 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows’ benefits because he was not a woman. The applicant appealed and his claims were consistently rejected up to the most recent decision dated 23 October 2000. 6. On an unspecified date the applicant made a claim to the Inland Revenue, requesting an allowance equivalent to that received by a widow, namely Widow’s Bereavement Allowance (“WBA”). After various rejections, on 20 September 2000 the Inland Revenue confirmed that he was ineligible for WBA as he was not a woman. 7. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security or tax benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law. 8. The relevant domestic law and practice is described in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, §§ 1426, ECHR 2002-IV; and Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen v. the United Kingdom, nos. 63684/00, 63475/00, 63484/00 and 63468/00, judgment of 26 March 2007.",1,223
1153,1153,"4. The applicant was born in 1931 and lives in Częstochowa. 5. On 29 July 1999 the applicant lodged a complaint with the City Council. He claimed that his neighbour, who lived upstairs, had carried out illegal construction work as a result of which the walls of the applicant's flat had begun to crack. 6. On 16 November 1999 an on-site inspection was conducted by the authorities. 7. On 27 November 1999 the applicant lodged a complaint about the inactivity of the authorities with the Principal Construction Inspector (Główny Inspektor Nadzoru Budowlanego). 8. On 1 December 1999 the District Construction Inspector discontinued the proceedings. It was found that the work had been carried out in conformity with the law. The applicant appealed to the Regional Construction Inspector. 9. On 16 December 1999 the applicant's complaint about inactivity was transferred to the Regional Construction Inspector. It appears that the proceedings concerning this complaint remained dormant until 19 February 2002. 10. On 25 February 2000 the Regional Construction Inspector quashed the decision of 1 December 1999 and remitted the case. 11. On 1 August 2000 the applicant lodged a complaint about inactivity with the Minister of the Interior. 12. On 7 August 2000 his complaint of 1 August 2000 was transferred to the Principal Construction Inspector. 13. On 1 September 2000 his complaint was transferred to the Regional Construction Inspector. 14. On 19 February 2002 the Regional Construction Inspector found the complaint about inactivity, not specifying which one, well-founded and fixed a new time-limit for the authorities to take all necessary action. 15. On 15 May 2002 the District Construction Inspector issued a decision. It found that the work had been brought into conformity with the law. The applicant appealed. 16. On 17 June 2002 the applicant again lodged a complaint about inactivity. 17. On 24 June 2003 the Regional Construction Inspector quashed the decision of 15 May 2002 and remitted the case. The applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court. 18. On 8 July 2003 the Principal Construction Inspector found the applicant's complaint about inactivity of 17 June 2002 well-founded and fixed a new 30 days' time-limit for the authorities. However the administrative authorities do not appear to have complied with the timelimit. 19. Eventually, as it transpires from the submissions of the applicant as well as from the observations submitted by the Government, on 21 September 2005 the Regional Administrative Court gave a judgment on the merits of the applicant's case. It further transpires that the applicant failed to lodge a cassation appeal with the Supreme Administrative Court. Hence, the judgment of 21 September 2005 became final. 20. For a presentation of domestic law, see: Kaniewski v. Poland, no. 38049/02, 8 February 2006; Koss v. Poland, no. 52495/99, 28 March 2006. 21.

1154,1154,"4. The applicants were born in 1960 and 1928 respectively and live in Budapest. 5. On 8 November 1996 the applicants brought an action against Mr M., claiming moral damages for the latter’s insulting behaviour. The Dombóvár District Court initially suspended the proceedings pending the outcome of the criminal case being conducted against the respondent. A first judgment was eventually given on 15 April 1998 but was quashed on appeal on 27 May 1999. Subsequently, the case was assigned to the Szekszárd District Court. This court joined two further cases pending between the same parties to the principal action. 6. The joint proceedings later continued before the Buda Surroundings District Court. This court held numerous hearings between 24 January 2002 and 27 March 2007. Although the applicants did not attend several hearings, it appears that they requested the court to continue with their case in their absence. Ultimately, the District Court found for the applicants on 31 May 2007. 7. On 10 June 1999 Mr Kalmár brought an official liability action against the Attorney General’s Office. The case was assigned to the Pest County Regional Court. On 17 September 2000 this court adjudicated some of the plaintiff’s claims and disjoined others, the examination of which was suspended pending the outcome of another case. In the latter connection, the proceedings were resumed on 19 December 2001. However, no hearing took place until 4 October 2006. Further hearings took place on 14 March 2007 and 14 April 2008. According to the information in the case file, this case is still pending. 8. In 2001 Mr Kalmár was found guilty of making false accusations. On 30 July 2003 he requested a retrial. According to the information in the case file, that request is still pending. 9. On 5 August 2004 Ms J. filed a criminal report against Mr Kalmár, accusing him of libel. A hearing took place on 20 March 2006, at which Mr Kalmár complained that he had not been properly informed of the charges against him. His motion for bias against the police authority dealing with the case was dismissed, and his ensuing complaint, filed on 3 December 2004, does not appear to have been answered. 10. On 17 May 2006 Mr Kalmár challenged the Budapest XX/XXI/XXIII District Court for bias. His motion was rejected on 2 June 2006. According to the information in the case file, these proceedings are still pending.",1,401
1156,1156,"4. At the time of the events the applicant was serving in the Turkish Navy. On 8 July 2008 the military prosecutor filed an indictment against the applicant with the Kasımpaşa Military Criminal Court (Kuzey Deniz Saha Komutanlığı Askeri Mahkemesi). He accused the applicant of wilfully disobeying his superior contrary to section 87 of the Military Criminal Code. 5. On 18 February 2009 the Kasımpaşa Military Criminal Court, composed of a military officer with no legal background and two military judges, found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to two months and fifteen days’ imprisonment. 6. On 21 July 2009 the Military Court of Cassation rejected the applicant’s appeal. The applicant stated that he learned of this decision on 23 September 2009 when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office. The applicant served his prison sentence between 5 November and 25 December 2009. 7. The relevant provisions of the Constitution provide: “Judicial power shall be exercised by independent courts on behalf of the Turkish Nation.” “In the performance of their duties, judges shall be independent; they shall give judgment according to their personal conviction, in accordance with the Constitution, statute and the Law. No organ, authority, officer or other person may give orders or instructions to courts or judges in the exercise of their judicial powers, or send them circulars, or make recommendations or suggestions to them. ...” “Judges ... shall not be removed from their office or compelled to retire without their consent before the age prescribed by the Constitution.” “The personal rights and obligations of military judges ... shall be regulated by law in accordance with the principles of the independence of the courts, the safeguards enjoyed by the judiciary and the requirements of military service. Relations between military judges and the commanders under whom they serve as regards their non-judicial duties shall also be regulated by law...” “Military courts shall be composed of two military judges and a military officer.” 8. In a decision dated 7 May 2009 and published in the Official Gazette on 7 October 2009, the Constitutional Court examined the independence and impartiality of military courts on account of the presence of a military officer on the bench. The Constitutional Court firstly pointed out that the officer sitting on the bench of the military criminal court was appointed on a case by case basis by his hierarchical superiors and continued to perform his other military duties while also acting as a judge. Noting that the military officer remained in the service of the military authorities, the Constitutional Court found that military courts could not be considered as compatible with the principle of judicial independence guaranteed under Article 9 of the Constitution. As a result, the Constitutional Court decided to repeal section 2(1) of Law no. 353 on the Composition and Functioning of Military Courts. The decision of the Constitutional Court became effective one year after its publication in the official gazette.",1,489
1160,1160,"4. The applicants were born in 1955 and 1965 respectively. The first applicant lives in Batman and the second applicant is currently detained in the Gaziantep Prison. 5. On 13 March 1993 the applicants were taken into custody by policemen from the Anti-Terrorism Branch of the Batman Security Directorate on suspicion of their membership of an illegal organisation, namely the Workers' Party of Kurdistan (“the PKK”). 6. On 13 April 1993 the applicants were brought before the public prosecutor and subsequently the investigating judge, who ordered the applicants' detention on remand. 7. On 26 April 1993 the Diyarbakır State Security Court Public Prosecutor filed an indictment against 38 accused persons, including the applicants. He accused the first applicant of membership of the PKK and requested the court to sentence him under Article 168 § 2 of the Criminal Code. The public prosecutor further accused the second applicant of carrying out activities aimed at breaking up the unity of the State and removing part of the national territory from the State's control. The prosecutor requested the court to sentence him in accordance with Article 125 of the Criminal Code. 8. On 18 June 1999 the constitution was amended and the military judge sitting on the bench of the Diyarbakır State Security Court was replaced by a civilian judge. 9. Between 16 June 1993 and 12 March 2002, the court held 69 hearings. On 12 March 2002 the Diyarbakır State Security Court, which was composed of three civilian judges, acquitted the first applicant of the charges against him. The court further found the second applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to the death penalty under Article 125 of the Criminal Code. The death penalty was commuted to a life sentence. 10. On 1 October 2002 the Court of Cassation upheld the decision of the Diyarbakır State Security Court.",1,307
1163,1163,"The applicant, Mr Waldemar Baran-Baranowski, is a Polish national who was born in 1944 and is currently serving a prison sentence at the Prison in Katowice. He was represented before the Court by Mr J. Zaleski, a lawyer practising in Katowice. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 20 May 2003 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of trafficking in drugs and counterfeit US dollars while leading an organised criminal group. Later, several other members of the same criminal group were detained and charged in connection with the investigation of the applicant’s activities. The investigation was conducted by the Organised Crime Department of the Katowice Regional Prosecutor’s Office. On 21 May 2003 the Katowice District Court remanded the applicant in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question. It also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might tamper with evidence, go into hiding or induce witnesses to give false testimony. The court also stressed the severity of the anticipated sentence. An appeal by the applicant against the detention order was dismissed on 18 June 2003 by the Katowice Regional Court. Subsequent appeals against decisions extending his detention were all unsuccessful. In his appeals he argued that the charges against him were based on unreliable and contradictory evidence. He further pleaded not guilty. On 23 December 2003 the applicant began serving a twenty-five-year prison sentence, given by the Olsztyn Regional Court in a different set of criminal proceedings. In the course of the investigation, the applicant’s detention was extended on several occasions, inter alia on 5 August and 7 November 2003 and 13 February and 23 April 2004 by the Katowice Regional Court, 12 May and 22 September 2004, 13 May and 7 December 2005, 8 March, 27 September and 20 December 2006, and 4 April, 24 October and 28 December 2007 by the Katowice Court of Appeal. On 6 February 2008, on a decision by the Katowice Court of Appeal the applicant’s detention was further extended until 30 April 2008. In all their detention decisions the authorities repeatedly relied on the original grounds given for the applicant’s detention. They considered that the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, in particular the need to verify evidence from thirty-three suspects and fifty witnesses and to have them all confronted justified holding him in custody. They further stressed the extensive body of evidence to be considered in the case and the need to obtain opinions from several experts, including those with expertise in toxicology and chemistry. On 17 April 2008 the Katowice Regional Court decided to lodge a request with the Katowice Court of Appeal to have the applicant’s detention further extended until 31 July 2008. On 14 December 2004 the Katowice Regional Prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with the Katowice Regional Court. The bill of indictment comprised numerous charges of trafficking in drugs and other illicit substances and counterfeit US dollars brought against several defendants, who were all acting in an organised criminal group. The maximum anticipated prison sentence against the applicant was more than eight years. On 16 July 2008 the Katowice Regional Court delivered a judgment. The applicant was found guilty as charged and sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment. He appealed. At present the appeal proceedings are pending. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of detention during judicial proceedings (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its extension, release from detention and rules governing other “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) are stated in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Gołek v. Poland, no. 31330/02, §§ 27-33, 25 April 2006 and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, §§ 22-23, 4 August 2006.",0,655

On 6 September 2000 the Krasnolutchsk City Court ordered the Krasnolutchska State Mine to supply the applicant with 8,850 kg of coal. 6. On 6 October 2000 the Krasnolutchsk City Bailiffs’ Service instituted enforcement proceedings in respect of that judgment. 7. On 5 May 2003 the Bailiffs’ Service informed the applicant that the judgment could not be enforced due to the large number of enforcement proceedings against the debtor and the fact that the procedure for the forced sale of assets belonging to the debtor had been suspended because of the moratorium on the forced sale of property belonging to State enterprises introduced by the Law of 29 November 2001. 8. On 21 October 2004 the judgment was enforced in full. 9. On 30 July 2003 the same court ordered the Mine to supply the applicant with another 8,850 kg of coal. 10. On 1 September 2003 the Krasnolutchsk City Bailiffs’ Service instituted enforcement proceedings in respect of the judgment of 30 July 2003. 11. On 19 October 2004 that judgment was also enforced in full. 12. The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-18, 27 July 2004).",1,217
1169,1169,"The applicant, Mr Teimuraz Andronikashvili, is a Georgian national who was born in 1928 and lives in Tbilisi. He was represented before the Court by Mr Alexander Baramidze, Mr Irakli Kandashvili and Mr Hans von Sachsen-Altenburg, lawyers practising in Tbilisi. The Georgian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Levan Meskhoradze of the Ministry of Justice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant's father, a member of the Georgian aristocracy, was deprived of his land and other assets by the Soviet Government during the 1920s and 1930s. On 25 May 2005 the applicant brought an action against the relevant local authority, seeking restitution of his ancestral lands. In support of his claim, the applicant submitted archives confirming his father's title to the claimed land and, as a legal basis, referred to general rules on the protection of property and inheritance contained in the Civil Code, the Constitution and the international human-rights treaties ratified by Georgia. The action was registered by the Gurjaani District Court on the same day. According to the file as it stands at present, the restitution proceedings are still pending at first instance; no hearing has been held so far. Article 172 of the Civil Code bearing on the protection of ownership reads as follows: Article 172 §§ 1 and 2 “1. The owner can claim the asset back from the possessor unless the latter is entitled to possess it. 2. In the event of interference with the exercise of ownership other than the taking of the asset, the owner may request the trespasser to put an end to such an action. If the interference persists, the owner may bring a court action against the trespasser.” By passing the Act of 11 December 1997, the Georgian State recognised that Georgian nationals were subjected to political persecution by the Soviet State between February 1921 and 28 October 1991, entitling the victims to seek rehabilitation. The Act defined the notion of a victim of political persecution and created a procedure by which to obtain that status. In particular, section 6 of the Act provided that only a court could declare a person to be a victim. Section 3 specified that the next of kin of a direct victim was also entitled to seek rehabilitation. Section 8 (1) and (2) stated that, once recognised as a victim of political repression, the person in question would automatically have his or her political and civil rights reinstated. This excluded the reinstatement of any property rights, in so far as subsection 3 of the same section specified that “the means for the restitution of property of victims of political repression shall be governed by a separate Act”. No act concerning the restitution of property of victims of Soviet repression has yet been passed. In a decision of 31 July 1998, the Gori District Court reinstated the ownership rights of the claimant Mrs E. Cholokashvili over her late parents' land expropriated by the Soviet State in the 1930s. Mrs Cholokashvili had previously been recognised as a victim of Soviet repression within the meaning of the Act of 11 December 1997. Likewise, in a decision of the Krtsanisi-Mtatsminda District Court in Tbilisi of 24 October 2000, Mrs K. Chachua-Daghundaridze and Mrs T. Daghundaridze, the claimants, were declared the owners of assets once belonging to their ancestors who had been recognised as victims of Soviet repression. Another similar case was that of Mr N. Abkhazi, who, in a decision of 18 January 2005 of the Gurjaani Distrcit Court, was granted title to land expropriated from his grandfather by the Soviet State in 1923 and 1924. The only difference between this and the two above-mentioned cases was that, prior to the restitution of the property, neither Mr Abkhazi, the claimant, nor any of his ancestors had been recognised as victims of the Soviet State within the meaning of the Act of 11 December 1997. In all three above-mentioned cases, the claimants were excused from having missed the statutory time-limit for recovery of property, in view of the fact that the expropriation of their ancestors' property had been carried out by force and the respondents were either private persons or public agencies. The domestic courts' reasons underlying their decisions to allow restitution were based on the general principles of protection of property and the inheritance rules contained in the Civil Code, the Constitution and international human-rights treaties. Certain other general principles of law, such as equity, were also relied on. As acknowledged by the President of the Supreme Court in his foreword to its Recommendations, one of the problems of the Georgian judiciary was the lack of consistent case-law on similar disputes. Consequently, the Supreme Court deemed it necessary, for the purposes of harmonising judicial practice, to advise the lower courts on how certain types of dispute should be resolved. The President noted that the Recommendations were not of a mandatory nature but emphasised their significance. Chapter XIV of the Recommendations advised the courts that they should declare claims for restitution of property expropriated by the Soviet State in the 1920s and 1930s admissible but refuse them on the merits in view of the absence of a right to restitution under Georgian law.",0,877
1172,1172,"The applicant, Mr Jarmo Eskelinen, a lawyer by profession, is a Finnish national who was born in 1951 and lives in Hämeenlinna. He is not represented before the Court. The respondent Government are represented by their Agent, Mr A. Kosonen, Director in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant was appointed as liquidator in the winding up of a company. He acted with another lawyer who embezzled the company’s and other companies’ funds. In criminal proceedings, eleven companies which were being wound-up claimed compensation for losses caused by the embezzlement. The embezzler was convicted and ordered to pay compensation for the damage he had caused, but was found to be insolvent. The companies commenced actions for compensation against the law office for which the convicted lawyer had worked, against his fellow partners and against those lawyers who had acted as co-liquidators with him as well as against their law offices. On 12 July 1996 the company in respect of which the applicant had been appointed as liquidator, commenced an action against him, among others, before the District Court of Lahti (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten). The summons was served upon the applicant on 6 August 1996. He filed his submissions on 7 October 1996. Due to the substantial connections between the actions, the District Court decided to deal with them jointly. Negotiations for a friendly settlement between the parties were held. At least as far as the applicant was concerned, they were fruitless. The companies submitted additional written observations on 30 April 1997. At the same time, they commenced an additional action. The District Court held three preparatory hearings, on 5 and 10 November and 8 December 1997. The main hearings were held on 10 to 12 and 15 December 1997. The District Court dismissed the action against the applicant on 6 February 1998. The companies, among others, appealed. At the appellants’ request, the time-limit for submission of the letters of appeal was extended. The time-limit for submission of the observations in reply was accordingly automatically extended until 14 May 1998. On 20 May 1999 the Kouvola Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovrätten) upheld without an oral hearing the District Court’s judgment as far as the applicant was concerned. The companies’ applications for leave to appeal were submitted on 16 July 1999. On 11 May 2000 the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen) granted leave to appeal and invited the applicant, amongst others, to submit observations in reply by 16 June 2000. The case was examined by the Supreme Court during 7 sessions, on 10 and 11 October 2000, 10 November 2000, 8 and 9 February 2001 and 4 and 30 May 2001. On 9 August 2001 the Supreme Court annulled the Court of Appeal’s judgment and found in favour of the companies, ordering the applicant and others jointly to pay damages, amounting to FIM 1,425,440 (EUR 239,742) with interest as from 6 August 1996, and legal expenses. The applicant’s insurance covered FIM 1,055,170 (EUR 177,467) and he paid FIM 510,749 (EUR 85,902) from his own funds. Under chapter 16, section 4 of the Judicial Procedure Code (oikeudenkäymiskaari, rättegångsbalken), as in force until 1 October 1997, a court was to adjourn criminal proceedings on request, for example if a party wished to adduce further evidence and the court was satisfied there was a good reason for the adjournment. The court could not adjourn criminal proceedings of its own motion save for special reasons. Where the defendant in criminal proceedings was in detention, under a travel-ban or disqualified from holding office, a case could not be adjourned for more than two weeks save for carrying out a mental examination of the defendant. If a party considered that the proceedings had been unjustifiably delayed, a procedural complaint (kantelu, klagan) could be lodged with the court of appeal within 30 days from the date of adjournment.",0,654
1174,1174,"The applicant, Benet Praha, spol. s r.o., is a limited liability company incorporated under Czech law with its registered seat in Prague. It was represented before the Court by Mr P. Klimeš, a lawyer practising in Prague. The respondent Government were represented by their Agent, Mr V.A. Schorm, from the Ministry of Justice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In April 2001 criminal proceedings were instituted against a former manager of the applicant company on the suspicion of having committed tax evasion. Within the framework of the criminal proceedings a search of the applicant company's premises was carried out on 24 April 2001. Cash in several currencies in the total amount of approximately CZK 20 mil. (EUR 770,000) and several documents such as financial files, books of accounts and business documents were seized. According to the applicant company these documents and most of the cash have not yet been returned to it. On 25 and 27 April 2001, the prosecuting authorities seized all of the applicant company's assets deposited on its five bank accounts on the suspicion that they constituted a profit from criminal activities of the manager. The seizure orders, which were notified to the applicant company on 8 October 2001, did not specify what assets had been seized, nor to what amount. This was remedied on 28 November 2001 by the Prague High Prosecutor (vrchní státní zástupce) who amended the original decisions by writing in the sums to be seized. While doing so, he froze all assets deposited on the applicant company's accounts on that day, i.e. inclusive of payments which had come in after 25 April 2001 and 27 April 2001, respectively. The applicant company's assets amounting to CZK 101,909,105 (EUR 3,919,580) were thus seized. The criminal proceedings against the former manager of the applicant company are currently pending before an appellate court. On 4 June 2009 the Prague Municipal Court acquitted the manager. The prosecutor, however, appealed. During the investigation the prosecuting authorities, inter alia, collected over 100,000 pages of documentary evidence, interviewed several hundred witnesses and requested legal assistance from the competent authorities of 16 countries. Meanwhile, numerous tax and custom proceedings were brought against the applicant company in regard of a suspected retrenchment. They all were later discontinued as no tax and customs evasion by the applicant company was detected. On 25 March 2005 the applicant company lodged a request with the police, seeking to have the seizure of its bank accounts lifted. On 11 April 2005 the request was transferred to the High Prosecutor who, on 24 June 2005, dismissed it, stating that the reasons for the seizure continued. The High Prosecutor added that the fact that the tax proceedings brought against the applicant company had been discontinued was irrelevant to the seizure. On 14 July 2004 the applicant company appealed to the Prague High Court (vrchní soud) which dismissed the appeal on 11 August 2005. On 16 November 2005 the applicant company lodged a constitutional appeal against the High Court's decision of 11 August 2005. In the appeal, the applicant company claimed that the seizure of its assets was disproportionate due to its excessive length. On 9 March 2006 the Constitutional Court (Ústavní soud) declared the appeal inadmissible, finding that a fair balance between the general interest of the society and those of the applicant company arising from its fundamental rights had been struck. The decision was served on the applicant company's lawyer on 16 March 2006. On 30 January 2008 the Constitutional Court found a violation of the right to property of a company Benet Czech, spol. s r.o., which was in a similar position as the applicant company. It held that the length of the seizure, over six years, was unreasonable, which thus disrupted the fair balance between the general interest of fighting serious crime and the protection of the rights of the applicant company. The applicant company lodged another request for the seizure of its bank accounts to be lifted referring to this decision of the Constitutional Court. On 6 March 2008 the High Prosecutor lifted the seizure of the applicant company's bank accounts holding that the conclusions of the Constitutional Court applied also to the applicant company.",0,708
1175,1175,"The applicant, Mr Brian Anthony Hill, is a British national, who was born in 1963 and lives in Gloucester (UK). The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. On 20 November 1986, the Provincial High Court of Valencia convicted the applicant and his brother of arson and sentenced them to a term of imprisonment of six years and one day. The applicant lodged an appeal (recurso de casación) to the Spanish Supreme Court. On 6 July 1988, the Supreme Court rejected the appeal. The amparo appeal to the Constitutional Court was rejected on 8 May 1989. On 1 October 1992, the applicant and his brother submitted an application to the UN Human Rights Committee complaining that their right to a fair trial had been breached by the Spanish courts, namely the Provincial High Court of Valencia. Invoking several provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, they complained of the judicial authorities’ repeated refusal to grant bail before the trial, of the lack of competent interpreters during the interrogation by the police, that during the trial the legal aid lawyer had not defended them properly, and that his brother had been denied the right to defend himself in person. On 2 April 1997, the Human Rights Committee found Spain to be in breach of Articles 9 § 3, 10 and 14 § 3 (c) and 5 of the Covenant. In the subsequent response given to the Human Rights Committee’ findings, the Spanish Government, on 9 October 1997, guaranteed the applicant the right to administrative and judicial redress by the way of domestic legal procedures and, if necessary, by means of supranational organisations. On 10 June 1998, the applicant instituted two sets of proceedings. First, he claimed compensation from the Ministry of Justice for the defective operation of the machinery of justice under sections 292 and seq., of the Judicature Act (Ley Orgánica del Poder Judicial LOPJ). This appeal is still pending. Secondly, he lodged a judicial appeal with the Provincial High Court of Valencia asking for the annulment of the criminal proceedings. On 12 November 1999, the Provincial High Court of Valencia rejected the appeal on the ground that it had not been lodged within the specified time limit of five years after the notification of the judgment of 20 November 1986. Invoking Article 24 of the Spanish Constitution (right to a fair trial), the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with the Constitutional Court. By a decision of 13 November 2000, the Constitutional Court rejected the amparo appeal. The Court declared that granting compensation for the defective operation of the machinery of justice could be considered in certain circumstances as effective reparation in the case of a violation of Article 24 of the Constitution. However, when a person had been deprived of his liberty as in the present case, the grant of compensation was not the most appropriate way of remedying the infringement of fundamental rights. In these cases, the nullity appeal was not the only possibility and the applicant had at his disposal either an application for a retrial (recurso de revisión) or an application based on judicial error. The court came to the conclusion that the alleged violation could still be remedied. Consequently, it rejected the amparo appeal for non-exhaustion.",0,551
1182,1182,"The applicant, Mr Joachim Berger, is a German national who was born in 1956 and lives in Singen. He is represented before the Court by Mr O. Berg, a lawyer practising in Strasbourg. The respondent Government are represented by their Agent, Mrs A. Wittling-Vogel, Ministerialdirigentin, of the Federal Ministry of Justice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In March 1996 the applicant was first questioned by the police on suspicion of three counts of abetting economic subsidy fraud. The indictment was issued on 15 September 1999. On 16 May 2002 the Mühlhausen Regional Court opened the main proceedings. On 6 June 2005 the Mühlhausen Regional Court informed the applicant that it intended to terminate the proceedings in accordance with Article 206a of the Code of Criminal Procedure as it considered that the length of proceedings precluded their continuation (see “Relevant domestic law” below). On 12 June 2005 the applicant gave his consent to that discontinuation. On 16 June 2005 the prosecutor’s office submitted that it would contest such termination of the proceedings. However, it suggested discontinuing the proceedings in accordance with Article 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see “Relevant domestic law” below). On 23 June 2005 the Regional Court discontinued the proceedings in accordance with Article 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure after the applicant’s lawyer had agreed to the proposed termination of the proceedings on the same day. On the same day the sitting judge of the Regional Court instructed the court’s registry to formally serve the discontinuation order on the applicant’s defence counsel and to informally transmit a copy of that decision to the applicant together with other documents, such as the submissions of the Public Prosecutor’s Office of 16 June 2005. On 24 June 2005 the applicant’s defence counsel acknowledged receipt of the court’s decision of 23 June 2005. On an unspecified date the applicant received the Regional Court’s letter of 23 June 2005; however, it is disputed between the parties whether that letter contained the court’s decision to discontinue the proceedings. Between 24 June 2005 and 27 July 2005 the applicant addressed further letters to the Regional Court requesting the court to comply with its obligation to proceed speedily. On 12 November 2007 the Court requested that the applicant provide information as to whether the proceedings had been discontinued in the meantime. On 26 November 2007 the applicant replied that he had not received any information about the discontinuation of the proceedings and that he did not know whether a discontinuation was imminent or intended. Therefore, on 22 January 2008 the Court decided to communicate the application to the respondent Government concerning the length of the proceedings. Under Article 206a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the court may terminate the proceedings by an order made outside the main hearing should a procedural impediment arise after the main proceedings have started. Thus the length of proceedings may preclude their continuation if, in exceptional circumstances, redress for the length of proceedings cannot be granted in a decision on the merits. Article 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure governs the discontinuation of criminal proceedings on the ground of insignificance. During the investigation proceedings the Public Prosecutor’s Office may discontinue the criminal proceedings if they concern an offence that does not carry a sentence of at least one year’s imprisonment (Vergehen), if the defendant’s guilt is of a minor nature and if there is no public interest in criminal prosecution. The court which has jurisdiction to open the main proceedings must consent to discontinuing the proceedings unless they concern offences which are not subject to an increased minimum penalty and the consequences ensuing from the offence were minor (Article 153 § 1). If the indictment has already been preferred with the court the latter may discontinue the proceedings at any stage under the conditions set out in Article 153 § 1 with the consent of both the public prosecutor’s office and the defendant (Article 153 § 2).",0,671
1184,1184,"The applicants, Todor Ivanov Todorov and Petranka Ruseva Todorova, are Bulgarian nationals who were born in 1944 and 1948 respectively and live in Varna. They are represented before the Court by Mr M. Ekimdjiev and Mrs K. Boncheva, lawyers practising in Plovdiv. The applicants are spouses. In 1986 they bought from the Varna municipality a State-owned apartment, which had been managed by the company C. On 7 January 1991 the applicants bought from the municipality an attic room in the same building for 4,034 old Bulgarian levs (“BGL”). Apparently, following the legal reforms of the 1990s (see below, Relevant background facts, domestic law and practice), the company C. considered that it had become the owner of the attic room and on an unspecified date it granted the tenancy of the room to Mr and Mrs P. In 1997 the applicants brought a rei vindicatio action against Mr and Mrs P. claiming the possession of the room. In a judgment of 25 June 1998 the Varna District Court dismissed the claim. On 9 August 1999 the Varna Regional Court upheld the lower court’s judgment. It found, inter alia, that the sale contract of 7 January 1991 was null and void ab initio as it had not been signed by the mayor, as required by law, but by another official of the municipality. The applicants, thus, had not shown that they were the owners of the attic room. In the meanwhile, on 30 April 1999 the company C. sold the attic room to Mr and Mrs P. On 27 February 2001 the applicants brought an action against C. seeking back the price they had paid for the attic room in 1991, updated in accordance with the inflation indexes. On 4 April 2002 the Varna Regional Court dismissed the claim finding that the 7 January 1991 sale contract had been found to be null and void in proceedings, which had not involved the company C.; it was not therefore bound by this founding of nullity. Upon appeal by the applicants, on 16 January 2003 the Varna Court of Appeal reversed the judgment and held that the applicants were in principle entitled to recovery of the sum. It awarded them the amount they had paid for the attic in 1991, the equivalent of BGL 4,034. However, as a result of inflation and the depreciation of the Bulgarian currency after 1991, the sum amounted to approximately EUR 2. In a final judgment of 18 March 2004 the Supreme Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants’ claim. It found that the action had been time-barred as the five-year time limit for seeking the recovery of what had been paid under a void contract started running from the day of payment, which in this case had been in 1991. By section 55 (1) of the Obligations and Contracts Act, everyone who has paid a sum of money on a non-existent ground is entitled to seek its recovery. In a binding interpretative decision of 1979 the Supreme Court of Bulgaria (now Supreme Court of Cassation) held that the time-limit to bring such an action started running from the moment of payment (Interpretive Decision No. 1 of the Plenary of the Supreme Court of 28 May 1979, case No. 1/79). In accordance with the Bulgarian courts’ established practice revalorisation of claims to reflect inflation and currency depreciation is not possible. Until the beginning of the 1990s, all commercial assets were the property of the State and were only allocated to State enterprises for “use and management”. After the beginning of democratisation and economic change and the ensuing transformation of these enterprises into State-owned limited liability or joint stock companies, the transformed companies acquired ownership of real estate or other assets they had used and managed (see, for more detail, the Court’s description of this transformation in the case of Credit Bank and Others v. Bulgaria (no. 40064/98, ECHR 30 April 2002)).",0,651
1189,1189,"The applicant, Mr Lars Rendahl, is a Swedish national, who was born in 1946 and lives in Hestra. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant owned or partly owned several newspaper companies that went bankrupt in 1991 amidst considerable media attention. On behalf of two of these companies, Lokaltidningen i Finbergen AB and Kronobergaren, in April 1991 the applicant as the managing director applied for state subsidies from the Swedish Press Subsidies Board (Presstödsnämnden), a central Government authority responsible for safeguarding the diversity of Sweden’s daily newspapers by allocating state subsidies to the daily press. State subsidies were granted in the amount of maximum 966.975 Swedish kronor (SEK) and would be payable on the presentation of invoices proving that the investments for which the subsidies were applied were actually made. The applicant submitted an invoice of 3 May 1991 from a computer company, AboData AB (partly owned by applicant), to Lokaltidningen i Finbergen AB in the amount of SEK 1.243.120, and accordingly on 21 May 1991 state subsidies in the amount of SEK 932.340 were paid to the applicant. Kronobergaren went bankrupt on 1 November 1991 and Lokaltidningen i Finbergen AB went bankrupt on 16 December 1991. In the meantime, on 4 December 1991 the Swedish Press Subsidies Board submitted a report to the police, indicating that the invoice of 3 May 1991 was false and that the applicant had therefore fraudulently appropriated the subsidies paid. A police investigation commenced on 6 December 1991. Five witnesses were heard during the period of 20 May and 16 September 1992. On 23 November 1992 the applicant was questioned by the police and formally notified about the suspicions against him. He was re-interrogated on 19 May 1993. On 27 May 1993 the applicant’s counsel requested a meeting with the prosecutor before a decision whether to bring charges against the applicant be taken. During the meeting, which could not take place until 6 October 1993, due to the counsel’s tight schedule, the applicant asked that a named witness on his behalf be heard. This witness was interviewed on 15 November 1993. On 31 May 1994, having decided to bring charges against the applicant, the public prosecutor sent a summons application to the District Court of Värnamo (Värnamo tingsrätt). On 13 June 1994 the trial was scheduled to take place on 25 August 1994, during which the applicant and five witnesses were heard. The applicant admitted that the invoice was false, he maintained however that subsequently he did invest the subsidies in the goods listed on the invoice. Having found that it could not be established that the Swedish Press Subsidies Board had suffered a loss, the District Court acquitted the applicant by judgment pronounced on 8 September 1994. On 26 September 1994 the prosecution lodged an appeal against the judgment to the Court of Appeal in Göta (Göta Hovrätt) and requested at the same time an extension of the time-limit to complete the appeal. A supplementary preliminary investigation was concluded by the prosecution on 24 October 1994, and on 8 November 1994 the prosecution’s appeal was completed entailing a request that six new witnesses be heard. As the applicant objected to one of these witnesses being heard, in the period between 9 November 1994 and 23 February 1995 written pleadings were submitted concerning this procedural question. By decision of 9 June 1995 the Court of Appeal allowed the new evidence to be submitted. On 30 August 1995 the trial was scheduled to take place on 17 and 18 October 1995. By judgment pronounced on 8 November 1995 the Court of Appeal found it established that the invoice was false and that at the time of the payment, i.e. on 21 May 1991, the applicant had put the Swedish Press Subsidies Board at risk of suffering a loss. The applicant was accordingly convicted of aggravated fraud pursuant to the Criminal Code and sentenced to one year’s imprisonment. His request for leave to appeal of 8 November 1995 was received in the Supreme Court (Högsta domstolen) on 11 December 1995, and having obtained an extension of the time-limit his request was completed on 5 March 1996. On 4 June 1996 the Supreme Court requested that the Prosecutor General submit written observations within four weeks. On 11 December 1996 and on 31 January 1997 a reminder in this respect was sent to the Prosecutor General and on 24 February 1997 the observations were submitted. The applicant’s comments thereto were submitted on 21 March 1997. On 26 May 1997 the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal.",0,768

The proceedings initiated upon the applicant’s motion On 27 July 1999 the applicant lodged an action against her father with the Warsaw District Court. She sought an increase of the amount of maintenance to be paid by her father, who was partially incapacitated. On 18 August 1999 the first hearing was held. On an unknown date the court requested the case file of the proceedings for annulment of the marriage of the applicant’s parents. On 25 August 1999 the applicant supplemented her action by seeking maintenance also from her grandfather. On 25 October 1999 the court was informed by the Warsaw Court of Appeal that in the proceedings for annulment of the applicant’s parents’ marriage the court had not ruled on the issue of the applicant’s maintenance. On 20 July 2000 the applicant amended her claim as she no longer wished to claim maintenance from her grandfather and changed the amount of maintenance claimed from her father. On 29 September 2000 the Warsaw District Court gave a judgment. The applicant’s father was ordered to pay the applicant monthly maintenance in the amount of 200 PLN in place of the previous amount of 80 PLN per month. The court made the judgment immediately enforceable. On 10 October 2000 the applicant’s father lodged an appeal. On 13 October 2000 the court requested the guardian of the applicant’s father to confirm his appeal as the applicant’s father was partially incapacitated.

1199,1199,"The applicant, Mr Krzysztof Dobrowolski, is a Polish national, who was born in 1974. He was represented before the Court by Mr Ł. Jura, a lawyer practising in Warsaw. The respondent Government were represented by Mr J. Wołąsiewicz, of the Ministry of the Foreign Affairs. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 18 April 2001 the Śrem District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) convicted the applicant of dealing in stolen goods and sentenced him to a sixteenmonth prison term. The applicant filed an appeal to the Poznań Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) in which he complained about the severity of the sentence. On 20 November 2001 the Regional Court informed the applicant that a legal aid counsel had been appointed for him and that an appeal hearing would take place on 30 November 2001. However, counsel never contacted the applicant. The applicant, who was serving a prison sentence in another case, asked that he be brought before the appellate court but his request was refused. On 30 November 2001, after a hearing at which the prosecutor and the applicant’s counsel, but not the applicant, were present, the Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. On 9 December 2001 the applicant asked the Court to serve him with a copy of the reasoned judgment with the purpose of lodging a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court. On 10 January 2002 the court served him the reasoned judgment. The applicant failed to lodge a cassation appeal within the time-limit and on 20 February 2002 the President of the Fourth Chamber of the Poznań Regional Court declared that the judgment was final. Under Article 519 of the 1997 Code of the Criminal Procedure, which entered into force on 1 September 1998, a party to criminal proceedings may lodge a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court against a final judgment of an appellate court which has terminated the criminal proceedings. Article 523 §1 of the 1997 Code provides, in so far as relevant: “A cassation appeal may be lodged only on the grounds referred to in Article 439 [these include a number of procedural irregularities, such as, for instance, incorrect composition of the trial court; lack of legal assistance in cases where such assistance was compulsory; breach of rules governing jurisdiction in criminal matters; trying a person in absentia where his presence was obligatory etc.] or on the ground of another flagrant breach of law provided that it could significantly affect the substance of the ruling in question. No cassation appeal may be directed against the severity of the penalty imposed.” A cassation appeal must be lodged within 30 days from the date of notification of the reasoned judgment of the appellate court (Article 524 of the 1997 Code). Pursuant to Article 451: The appellate court shall order an accused, who is detained, to be brought to the appellate hearing, unless it finds that the presence of his lawyer is sufficient. If the court decides not to bring to the hearing an accused who has no defence counsel, it shall appoint for him ex officio a legal aid lawyer. The Supreme Court has examined in numerous judgments cassation appeals based on the allegation that the absence of an accused at the appeal hearing was a flagrant breach of law that could significantly affect the substance of the ruling in question, within the meaning of Article 523 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Supreme Court on many occasions found that the refusal to bring the accused to the appeal hearing, although not in violation of the Code of Criminal Proceedings in force, constituted a breach of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention read in conjunction with Article 91 § 2 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland. In such cases, the Supreme Court quashed the appeal judgment and remitted the case (judgment of 10 August 2000, III KKN 192/00, judgment of 5 June 2001, III KKN 28/01). The resolution of 7 judges of the Supreme Court of 18 October 2001 (IKZP 25 /01) dealt with the Ombudsman’s request for clarification of issues relating to the presence of the accused at the appeal hearing in the light of Article 6 of the Convention and the Polish Code of the Criminal Procedure. The Supreme Court, inter alia, stated: “...Finally, it should be underlined, that even if the accused requests to be brought to the appeal hearing, the court may establish that the presence of the lawyer at the appeal hearing would be sufficient. If the accused does not have a counsel, it is necessary to appoint for him a legal aid lawyer whose presence at the hearing would be obligatory. It should however be noted that if an accused deprived of liberty requests to be brought to the appeal hearing, granting such request should be a rule... Finding that the presence of the lawyer would be sufficient could occur in particular if the appeal hearing concerned only questions of law.”",0,834

On 3 April 1995 it ordered the neighbours to carry out the necessary works by 1 September 1995. On 28 June 1995 the County Administrative Office essentially upheld this decision. On 31 July 1995 the neighbours brought an action seeking judicial review of the above administrative decisions. On 28 August 1995 the applicant challenged the competent Szekszárd District Court for bias. On 3 October 1995 she intervened in the proceedings on the side of the defendant Administrative Office. On 15 January 1996 the Supreme Court appointed the Nyíregyháza District Court to hear the case. On 26 June 1996 the District Court dismissed the plaintiffs’ action holding that the defendant Office’s procedure had been in compliance with the law. On appeal, on 10 December 1996 the Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg County Regional Court upheld this decision. The plaintiffs filed a petition for a review by the Supreme Court. On 17 March 1997 the applicant requested the enforcement of the Regional Court’s decision. In reply to the applicant’s enquiry, on 8 July 1997 the President of the Baranya County Regional Court confirmed that the pending review proceedings were not an obstacle to the execution of the decision of 10 December 1996. On 6 January 1999 the Supreme Court dismissed the plaintiffs’ petition for review. On 28 January 1999 the Komló Town Mayor’s Office ordered the execution of its decision of 3 April 1995. A time-limit was set for 15 June 1999. On 15 June 1999 the neighbours notified the Mayor’s Office that the works had been completed. On 22 June 1999 the applicant informed the Csongrád County Administrative Office that she was not satisfied with the technical solution adopted for the drainage works. On 3 July 1999 the Komló Town Mayor’s Office appointed an expert. On 24 August 1999 the Mayor’s Office, relying on the expert opinion, ordered the neighbours to alter the construction. After several postponements, the Mayor’s Office decided that they would have until 30 April 2001 to complete the necessary works. An inspection of the works was carried out on 18 May 2001. On 23 May 2001 a fine was imposed on the neighbours for non-compliance with the administrative orders. On appeal, on 17 August 2001 the County Administrative Office increased the amount of the fine. A further fine was imposed on the neighbours on 29 November 2001. On 23 May 2002 another inspection took place. It was found that a major part of the works had been completed. The applicant’s criminal complaints against various officials involved in the case were to no avail.",0,639

On 17 May 1974 Anne Massey was killed in a terrorist bombing in Dublin. The cars used for the bombing were stolen in Belfast in Northern Ireland on the same day. The Irish authorities conducted extensive inquiries but were unable to bring charges against any person. The files remain open. The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in Northern Ireland has conducted an inquiry into the theft of the vehicle and related offences which did not produce any results. However, there was no formal murder inquiry by the RUC. On 6 July 1993 ITV, a television station in the United Kingdom, broadcast a programme in which the adequacy of the RUC inquiry was discussed.",0,147

They all live in Silopi in south-east Turkey. 5. Between November 1992 and February 1993 the applicants were taken into police custody in Silopi by policemen on suspicion of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation, namely the PKK. 6. At the end of their police custody, the applicants were brought before the Şırnak Magistrate's Court in Criminal Matters and were subsequently placed in detention on remand. 7. On an unspecified date in 1993 the public prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court filed a bill of indictment. He accused the applicants of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation, and called for them to be sentenced pursuant to Article 169 of the Criminal Code. 8. The applicants were all released pending trial. 9. On 6 February 1996 the Diyarbakır State Security Court, which was composed of three judges including a military judge, found the applicants guilty as charged and sentenced them to different terms of imprisonment, ranging between two years and six months and three years and nine months. 10. On 9 June 1997 the Court of Cassation, upholding the Diyarbakır State Security Court's reasoning and assessment of evidence, dismissed the applicants' request for appeal. 11.

1217,1217,"5. The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Mionica. 6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 7. On 7 November 2001 the applicant, a bus conductor, was dismissed by his employer, “Lasta Strela”, a transportation company based in Valjevo. 8. On 24 December 2001 he filed a claim with the Municipal Court in Valjevo (“the Municipal Court”), seeking reinstatement and payment of salary arrears. 9. Following a remittal of 14 April 2003, the next hearing in the case was scheduled by the Municipal Court for 27 September 2004. 10. Of the nine separate hearings scheduled between 27 September 2004 and 26 January 2006, it would appear that four were adjourned whilst five were held. As regards the former, two hearings were adjourned because the respondent and/or several witnesses had not been duly summoned and the other two because witnesses, of whom two were proposed by the applicant, had, though duly summoned, failed to appear in court (for which omission they were ultimately fined). 11. On 27 January 2006 the Municipal Court ruled against the applicant. 12. On 25 April 2006 the applicant was served with this judgment. 13. On 3 May 2006 the applicant filed an appeal with the District Court in Valjevo (“the District Court”). 14. On 18 December 2006 the District Court returned the case file to the Municipal Court, requesting it to submit certain missing documents. 15. On 29 March 2007 the District Court upheld the judgment rendered at first instance. 16. On 3 April 2008 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s appeal on points of law (revizija). 17. Article 122 § 3 provided that all employment-related disputes were to be resolved by the courts within a period of 6 months from the date of institution of the proceedings. 18. This Act entered into force on 23 March 2005 and thereby repealed the Labour Act 2001. 19. The text of Article 195 § 3 of the Labour Act 2005 corresponds to Article 122 § 3 of the Labour Act 2001.",1,344
1220,1220,"The applicant, Mr Alan Hatten, is a British national who was born in 1941 and lives in Devon. He was represented before the Court by Royds Rdw, solicitors in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant’s wife died on 27 February 1997. On 8 August 2001 the applicant applied for widows’ benefits. On 20 September 2001 the applicant was informed that his claim had been disallowed as he was not a woman. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefit was payable to widowers under United Kingdom law. The applicant was not in receipt of child benefit at the time of his claim. The domestic law relevant to this application is set out in Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, §§ 1426, ECHR 2002-IV and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, §§ 40-41, 25 July 2007.",0,190
1222,1222,"The applicant, Royland McCalla, is a Jamaican national who was born in 1972 and lives in Nottingham. He is represented before the Court by Mr F.Vaz, a lawyer practising in Edgware. The applicant arrived in the United Kingdom in December 1999 and was granted leave to enter as a visitor until 17 January 2000. He applied for an extension which was granted until 20 June 2000. On 5 June 2000, he applied for a further extension as the husband of S., a British citizen whom he had married on 12 May 2000. Leave was granted for twelve months, expiring on 6 December 2001. S. had a daughter J. (born in 1998), by a previous relationship, who had regular contact with her natural father. Meanwhile in March 2001, the applicant was arrested for drugs offences. Following a plea of guilty to four counts of supplying crack cocaine and two counts of offering to supply, the applicant was sentenced on 4 June 2001 to five years' imprisonment. The judge did not make any recommendation for deportation. On 16 December 2001, S. gave birth to the applicant's son, R. On completion of one half of his sentence, the applicant was released on parole. On 10 July 2003, the Home Secretary gave notice of his decision to make a deportation order against the applicant, referring to his conviction in view of which he deemed it conducive to the public good to make such an order. The same day, the applicant appealed. Following a hearing, by a decision of 16 January 2004, the Adjudicator rejected his appeal. He gave weight to the applicant's good record in prison and his family circumstances. He noted that S. had relatives, including her parents, in Jamaica and had visited there on holiday, although she had lived all her life in the United Kingdom. Having regard however to the fact that the wife had a house and job in Nottingham, that R. had uncertain medical problems and J. had regular access with her natural father, he did not consider that it would be reasonable to expect the wife to emigrate to Jamaica, in particular as it would severe J.'s links with her natural father. Nonetheless, weighing these factors together with the seriousness of his offences, the short period in which the applicant had lived in the United Kingdom and the fact that the applicant and S. had married knowing that he was not a British citizen and did not have indefinite leave to remain, he found that the measure was not unjustified. On 15 April 2004, the Immigration Appeal Tribunal refused permission to appeal, finding no error in the Adjudicator's balancing of the relative factors. On 24 May 2004, the High Court refused an application for statutory review.",0,458
1224,1224,"7. The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Järvenpää. 8. The applicant’s home as well as the office premises of his various companies were searched on 7, 9 and 14 February 1995 and various materials were seized. The search warrants referred to an investigation into debtor’s dishonesty involving the company Lehtikarin Kirjapaino Oy as well as a book-keeping offence. Both offences were suspected to have been committed by the applicant between 5 June 1991 and 25 May 1994. 9. On 15 February 1995 the public prosecutor questioned the applicant in connection with other criminal proceedings which were pending against the applicant before the District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten) of Tuusula in respect of acts allegedly committed in April 1992 relating to the company UYP-Sijoitus Oy (“U.”). 10. On 27 April 1995 the estates of three wound-up companies, including U, reported an offence against the applicant for alleged offences of debtor’s dishonesty. 11. On 2 April 1996 the applicant was interrogated by the police. On 28 November 1996 he was charged with the offence of debtors’ dishonesty, allegedly committed between 7 and 23 April 1992. The estate of the wound-up company U. was indicated as one of the complainants. 12. On 12 February 1997 he received a summons to appear before the District Court on 19 March 1997. The summons had wrongly indicated the Judicial Building in Vantaa as the hearing venue instead of Tuusula. On 1 April 1997 the applicant was brought to the hearing of the District Court of Tuusula, the court having found that the applicant had no legal excuse for not having been present at the first hearing. 13. At the hearing on 27 November 1997 the applicant demanded that the charges against him be adequately particularised. 14. In a further letter of indictment dated 29 April 1998 the prosecutor presented alternative charges of aggravated tax fraud and aiding and abetting that crime. 15. On 8 July 1998 the applicant initiated civil proceedings against bank V. and requested that they be joined to the criminal proceedings. The District Court rejected this request. 16. At the hearing on 27 July 1998 the prosecutor, basing himself on a letter of indictment of the same day, specified the charges. 17. On 31 December 1998, at its 13th hearing, the District Court issued its judgment. It convicted the applicant of debtor’s dishonesty and sentenced him to eleven months’ unconditional imprisonment. He was ordered to pay some 10,000,000 Finnish Marks (FIM, almost 1,700,000 euros (EUR)) in damages. 18. The applicant appealed, appending his own writ of appeal to that of his counsel, P.V. In addition, he lodged numerous further submissions both within and outside the requisite time-limit, the last one in February 2002. Originally, the applicant requested an oral hearing and, in any case, that the Court of Appeal should reduce his sentence. In December 2001 he requested that the case be referred back to the District Court to be decided by a different composition of judges or, in the alternative, that the charges against him be dismissed as one judge had allegedly been partial and he had been refused leave to examine a witness. 19. In October 2001 the Court of Appeal, as requested, cancelled P.V.’s appointment and appointed P.I. as the applicant’s new legal aid counsel. 20. In its judgment of 15 March 2002 the Court of Appeal rejected his appeal and increased the sentence to a term of imprisonment of one year and two months. Having regard to the contents of the applicant’s appeal as filed within the time-limit, the Court of Appeal saw no need for an oral hearing. The court took into account three of the applicant’s further submissions as well as four submissions lodged by his new counsel, in so far as the requests therein had not deviated from his original appeal as filed within the requisite time-limit. Insofar as the applicant had alleged procedural defects the Court of Appeal considered most of his submissions belated as they had not been lodged within six months of the judgment of the District Court. 21. On 3 September 2002 the Supreme Court refused the applicant leave to appeal. 22. Under Chapter 16, Article 4 (2) of the Code of Judicial Procedure (oikeudenkäymiskaari, rättegångsbalken, as amended by Act no. 1052/1991 and in force at the relevant time) any party who considered that the proceedings before a district court were being unjustifiably delayed by an adjournment had the right to lodge a complaint with a Court of Appeal within 30 days from the date of the adjournment. Under the said provision the district court could adjourn the case upon request by a party, for example if the said party wished to adduce further evidence. The court could not adjourn the hearing proprio motu save on special grounds. Chapter 16, section 4 (2) was repealed with effect from 1 October 1997, when new provisions generally prohibited adjournments. 23. Chapter 6 of the Penal Code (rikoslaki, strafflagen, Act no. 515/2003) was amended with the effect as of 1 January 2004. Section 6, Article 7 sets out the grounds mitigating the punishment that are to be taken into consideration, including “a considerably long period that has passed since the commission of the offence”, if the punishment that accords with established practice would for this reason lead to an unreasonable or exceptionally detrimental result. 24. The Government referred to the Supreme Court’s precedent KKO 2005:73 concerning the relevance of the length of the proceedings when determining a sentence. In that case the defendants were sentenced to prison for one year and four months for aggravated tax-fraud. Their sentences were mitigated because of the length of the proceedings, which was 10 years.",1,948
1230,1230,"The applicant is a Turkish national, born in 1943 and living in Vakfıkebir, Turkey. He is represented before the Court by Mr Hasip Kaplan, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant claims that he was called to the Kürtün gendarme station on 24 October 1991 on suspicion of killing Hasan Bal on 18 July 1991 in a fight. He contends that he was immediately detained and during the first twenty-four hours he was not given anything to eat. He states that he was blindfolded. The period of his detention was extended by the Torul public prosecutor for fifteen days at the request of Halil Uluyurt, the captain of the Kürtün gendarme regiment. The applicant claims that he was beaten and tortured during his detention. On 1 November 1991 the Torul Peace Court ordered the applicant’s formal arrest. The applicant’s wife, Halime İpek, applied to the Torul Public Prosecutor’s Office on 12 November 1991 claiming that her husband had been tortured by gendarmes while in custody. The public prosecutor conducted a preliminary investigation. He took statements from Captain Halil Uluyurt as well as 19 other witnesses. On 31 December 1992 the public prosecutor issued a decision of non-prosecution. The applicant’s wife challenged the decision before the Bayburt Assize Court. On 12 February 1993 the Bayburt Assize Court accepted her submissions and annulled the non-prosecution decision. On 31 March 1993 the Torul public prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings before the Torul Criminal Court of First Instance charging Captain Halil Uluyurt and gendarme officers Ahmet Temur, Hasan Çelik and Mahmut Özmen of offences under Article 245 of the Turkish Penal Code. On 13 May 1993 the Torul Criminal Court of First Instance issued a non-jurisdiction decision and separated the proceedings against Captain Halil Uluyurt from those brought against the other co-accused on the ground inter alia that the charges were more appropriately dealt with under Article 243 of the Penal Code. The Torul Criminal Court of First Instance sent Captain Halil Uluyurt’s file to the Gümüşhane public prosecutor’s office to obtain the necessary authorisation to prosecute him. Authorisation was given by the General Directorate of Criminal Affairs of the Ministry of Justice and the Gümüşhane public prosecutor subsequently instituted criminal proceedings against Captain Halil Uluyurt before Gümüşhane Assize Court on 30 December 1993. On 10 February 1994 the court joined the cases of Captain Halil Uluyurt and the other three accused. The applicant joined the case as an intervening third party. The court had before it two medical reports. According to the first report dated 25 October 1991 no marks of violence had been found on the applicant’s person. However, the second medical report dated 1 November 1991 stated that the following marks were found on his body: an oedema about 4-5 cm in diameter on his right hand, a graze on his left leg of about 1 by 1 cm and a discolouring under his right eye. The medical reports were sent for examination to the Forensic Medicine Institute which concluded that the applicant’s health was not at risk. The applicant was given three days’ sick leave from work. The report of the Forensic Medicine Institute also mentioned that the applicant’s injuries could have been caused by blows. Although the witnesses called on behalf of the applicant stated before the court that they did not see him being beaten, they affirmed that they observed that he had some violet-coloured bruises on his face and body when he was brought before the substitute judge. The witnesses further maintained that the applicant told them that the commander of the gendarme station had tortured him during interrogation. In a judgment dated 2 May 1996, the Gümüşhane Assize Court found Captain Halil Uluyurt guilty of an offence under Article 243 of Criminal Code since he had tried to extract incriminating statements from the applicant. The court accepted that the applicant was subjected to ill treatment and to inhuman and degrading treatment in custody. The court relied on the statements of the witnesses, medical reports and the interrogation record signed by Captain Halil Uluyurt which indicated that he had questioned the applicant. The court sentenced Captain Halil Uluyurt to ten-months’ imprisonment and debarred him from duty for a period of two months and fifteen days. The court suspended the prison sentence since it considered that the accused would not commit any similar offences in the future. The court acquitted the other three accused on account of lack of evidence. Captain Halil Uluyurt appealed against conviction. On 7 May 1997 the Court of Cassation dismissed his appeal and sent its judgment to the Gümüşhane Assize Court on 5 June 1997 where it was deposited with the Registry. The applicant maintains that he was notified of this decision on 26 December 1997 when he went to the court to obtain a copy.",0,817
1234,1234,"8. The applicant is the owner of an apartment in Torre del Greco, which he had let to A.P. 9. In a writ served on the tenant on 24 October 1990, the applicant informed the tenant of his intention to terminate the lease on expiry of the term on 31 December 1991 and summoned him to appear before the Naples Magistrate. 10. By a decision of 30 November 1990, which was made enforceable on the same day, the Naples Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 31 December 1992. 11. On 11 March 1993, the applicant made a statutory declaration that he urgently required the premises as accommodation for his daughter. 12. On 19 March 1993, the applicant served notice on the tenant requiring him to vacate the premises. 13. On 7 April 1993, he served notice on the tenant informing him that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 26 April 1993. 14. Between 26 April 1993 and 16 January 1997, the bailiff made nine attempts to recover possession. Each attempt of the bailiff proved unsuccessful, as the applicant was never granted the assistance of the police in enforcing the order for possession. 15. On 28 April 1997, the tenant vacated the premises. 16. The relevant domestic law is described in the Court’s judgment in the case of Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, §§ 18-35, ECHR 1999-V.",1,244
1235,1235,"4. The applicants live in various towns of Leningrad and Pskov Regions of Russia. 5. The applicants, all former or active military servicepersons, were entitled to certain service-related benefits, to be paid by the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation. In 2002 they sued the military authorities claiming the arrears related to those benefits. 6. On the dates set out in appendixes nos. 2, 3 and 4 the domestic courts granted the applicants' claims and ordered the military authorities to pay them the respective amounts. Some of the awards were denominated in Russian roubles (RUB), whereas others were denominated in United States dollars (USD). 7. On various dates the courts issued writs of execution. The applicants forwarded them with accompanying documents to the treasury office. However, the writs were returned to the applicants unexecuted. The treasury office explained to some of the applicants that the Ministry of Defence (the debtor) had no funds available. The applicants then addressed the writs of execution to the Ministry of Finance. However, the judgments remained unexecuted. 8. In March-April 2003 some of the applicants wrote letters to the Ministry of Finance and other State bodies seeking the enforcement of the judgments. The Ministry of Finance replied that they had no power to execute the judgments and transfer the money from the accounts of the Ministry of Defence without the consent of the latter. The Ministry of Defence informed the applicants that the judgments could not be executed since no funds had been allocated for that purpose. 9. On the dates set out in appendix no. 2 the applicants listed therein received the amounts due pursuant to the execution writs. They submitted copies of banking receipts as evidence in that respect. 10. The applicants listed in appendix no. 3 were awarded various sums of money denominated in USD, to be converted into RUB at a rate applicable on the date of the judgment. However, the payments were made to them at a rate applicable on the date of the execution, which was lower. As a result, they received lesser amounts in RUB than they had expected. The applicants claimed that the judgments in their favour were thus not executed in full. They submitted copies of banking receipts and information on the official exchange rates (those of the Central Bank) on the relevant dates. 11. Mr Sedykh, Mr Kositsyn and Mr Oleg Zakirov were also awarded various amounts denominated in USD (see appendix no. 4). Mr Sedykh was awarded a sum in USD at a rate applicable on the date of execution. The judgments in favour of Mr Kositsyn and Mr Oleg Zakirov did not indicate the exchange rate applicable for the payment. The applicants claimed that the judgments in their favour were not executed in full referring to the same arguments as the applicants listed in appendix no. 3 (see paragraph 10 above). According to the Government the judgments in favour of the applicants listed in appendix no. 3 and in favour of Mr Sedykh, Mr Kositsyn and Mr Oleg Zakirov were fully executed. 12. On 21 January 2003 the lawyer of the above two applicants addressed the writs of execution to the Ministry of Finance. According to the official stamp of the Ministry, they were received on the same day. 13. On 27 August 2003 the Ministry of Finance returned the documents along with the writ of execution to Mr Nikolaychuk on the ground that his lawyer had not submitted all the necessary supporting documents. According to the applicants all the necessary documents were submitted. In October 2003 the applicants' lawyer re-submitted the documents of Mr Nikolaychuk to the Ministry of Finance. 14. According to Ms Bobrova, her documents were apparently returned to her address indicated on the writ of execution. Since Ms Bobrova did not live at that address at the time, the post office sent the documents back to the Ministry of Finance. According to the Government, the Ministry of Finance have never received Ms Bobrova's documents. 15. The judgments in favour of Mr Nikolaychuk and Ms Bobrova (see appendix no. 4) are not executed to date.",1,686
1245,1245,"4. The applicant was born in 1928 and lives in Brwinów. 5. On 15 June 1994 the applicant filed an application for the distribution of an inheritance left by his grandmother. 6. On numerous occasions the proceedings were suspended, mostly due to the successive deaths of the parties. The proceedings were: suspended on 30 November 1995; resumed on an unknown date in 1999; suspended on 25 January 2000; resumed on an unknown date in 2000 or 2001; suspended on 6 June 2001; resumed on 25 October 2004; suspended on 18 January 2005; resumed on 24 April 2006; suspended on 5 July 2006; resumed on 27 August 2007; suspended on 7 December 2007 but immediately resumed; suspended on 15 February 2008. 7. The proceedings are still pending before the court of first instance. 8. On 10 April 2009 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Warsaw Regional Court under the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki – “the 2004 Act”). He sought a finding that the length of the proceedings was excessive and compensation. 9. On 7 May 2009 the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed the applicant's complaint. In its assessment of the length of the proceedings, the Regional Court did not take into account the period before the entry into force of the 2004 Act. It then went on to analyse in detail the course of the proceedings, finding that the District Court had conducted them in a correct and timely manner. It further concluded that the long duration of the proceedings had resulted from numerous requests and motions filed by the parties as well as from the successive deaths of the parties. This obliged the District Court to suspend the proceedings each time. The Regional Court finally pointed out that it was incumbent on the parties and not on the court to determine the identity of the heirs of the deceased parties in order for the proceedings to be continued. 10. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court's decisions in the cases of Charzyński v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), §§ 12-23, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v.

1247,1247,"The applicant, Mr Jozef Bič, is a Slovakian national who was born in 1953 and lives in Košice. He was represented before the Court by Mr R. Žikla, a lawyer practising in Košice. The Government of the Slovak Republic (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs M. Pirošíková. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 15 October 1999 the applicant instituted proceedings before the Košice I District Court relating to his right to use an apartment. On 30 November 1999 two of the defendants submitted their comments in relation to the claim. The first hearing in the case was held on 29 November 2001. Two of the defendants failed to appear. The President of the District Court informed the applicant that the delay in the proceedings had been caused by the heavy workload of the judge dealing with the case. All three defendants failed to appear before the court on 25 January 2002. The court requested the police's co-operation in serving the summons on two of the defendants, one of whom lived in the Czech Republic. On 3 March 2002 another hearing was held. None of the defendants appeared. The summons had been served on one of them. On 16 April 2002 two of the defendants filed written submissions with the District Court. On 22 April 2002 the District Court imposed a procedural fine on one of the defendants. On 24 April 2002 the District Court asked for documentary evidence to be produced. Hearings were held on 23 May 2002 and on 13 September 2002. On 28 March 2003 the judge asked for further documentary evidence to be produced. A hearing was held on 23 April 2003. On 9 June 2003 the court inspected the apartment in issue. On 10 June 2003 the case was adjourned. The applicant was invited to specify his claim within two months. On 28 January 2004 one of the defendants asked the court to grant him access to the apartment. On 28 May 2004 and on 22 June 2004 the judge asked the applicant to inform the court whether an agreement had been reached between the parties. The applicant replied on 2 September 2004. On 24 February 2005 a hearing was held. Subsequently, a hearing was adjourned twice because the judge dealing with the case was on sick leave. On 29 June 2005 a hearing was held. Neither the applicant nor the defendants were present. It was not proved that the summons had been served on one of the defendants. The court imposed a procedural fine on the lawyer of the other two defendants. The lawyer was later exempted from payment of the fine. On 4 August 2005 the court notified the parties that the case had been assigned to a new judge and the hearing was adjourned. On the same day the court requested police co-operation in establishing the address of one of the defendants. On 5 September 2005 the police informed the court that the defendant was living abroad at an unknown address. On 26 October 2005 a hearing was held at which the applicant and all three defendants were present. The hearing was adjourned as further information was needed. The District Court delivered a judgment on 5 December 2005. It ordered one of the defendants to let the applicant use the apartment in issue within three days of the judgment becoming final. On 16 May 2006 the Košice Regional Court upheld the relevant part of the first-instance judgment. The decision in the case became final on 23 June 2006. On 8 January 2003 the Constitutional Court found that the Košice I District Court had violated the applicant's right under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention to a hearing within a reasonable time. The decision stated that the case was not complex and that the applicant had not contributed to the length of the proceedings. The District Court had remained inactive from 30 November 1999 to 29 November 2001. The Constitutional Court considered it appropriate to award the applicant 20,000 Slovakian korunas (SKK), payable by the District Court within two months. It also ordered the District Court to proceed with the case without any further delay. On 10 March 2005 the Constitutional Court found that the Košice I District Court had violated Article 6 § 1 in the proceedings concerning the applicant's action during the period subsequent to the delivery of the first decision on 8 January 2003. The Constitutional Court found that the case was not complex. While the applicant had not always replied to the court's requests within the time-limit set, his behaviour as a whole had not resulted in any unjustified delays in the proceedings. As to the conduct of the District Court, it had remained inactive from 29 December 2003 to 28 May 2004 (5 months) as well as from 2 September 2004 to 4 January 2005 (4 months). Despite the earlier order issued by the Constitutional Court, the District Court had not proceeded with the determination of the action in good time. The Constitutional Court awarded the applicant SKK 20,000 as just satisfaction, which the District Court was obliged to pay within two months. When determining the amount of just satisfaction, the Constitutional Court took into account, inter alia, that at a certain stage of the proceedings the applicant had not duly co-operated with the District Court. It further ordered the District Court to proceed with the case without any further delay and to reimburse the applicant's legal costs in the constitutional proceedings.",0,926
1250,1250,"5. The applicants were born in 1951 and 1979 respectively and live in Bodrum. The second applicant is the son of the first applicant. 6. On 28 June 2001 the Muğla Security Directorate asked the Bodrum Chief Public Prosecutor to issue an arrest warrant for sixteen persons who were suspected of being involved in an organised criminal gang. The gang was allegedly involved in bribing officials, threatening people into selling their property and in money laundering. The first applicant’s name was included in the list. Upon the request of the Bodrum Chief Public Prosecutor, the Bodrum Magistrates’ Court issued a warrant allowing the police to conduct searches of the houses of the suspected persons and to arrest them for the purposes of interrogation. 7. On the same day both applicants were taken into custody in Bodrum. The first applicant was arrested at his home. During the search of his residence the police found two pistols, five hunting rifles, one wire strangulation cord, one butterfly knife, four sets of handcuffs, five commando knives, two cartridge clips and twelve cartridges. The police prepared a search and arrest report, which was signed by the applicant. 8. The second applicant was working as a security guard in an exchange office owned by Ö.A, the person suspected of being the leader of the gang. While the police were conducting a search of the exchange office in order to arrest Ö.A., the second applicant arrived on the scene and was taken into custody for interrogation. 9. On 30 June 2001 the Muğla Security Directorate requested authorisation from the Bodrum Public Prosecutor to extend the applicants’ detention in police custody, as there were a number of suspects. 10. On 4 July 2001 both applicants gave statements to the police. They denied any involvement with the gang. In his statement, the first applicant explained that he knew Ö.A. and had occasionally lent him money. He also confirmed that he had bought a shop from him. However, he denied the allegation that he had been instructed by Ö.A. to threaten people. 11. On 5 July 2001 both applicants were interrogated by the Bodrum Public Prosecutor. During their questioning, the applicants repeated the statements they had made to the police. The second applicant was subsequently released. On the same day the first applicant was brought before the investigating judge at the Bodrum Magistrate’s Court, who subsequently ordered his detention on remand. 12. On 11 July 2001 the first applicant filed an objection against the remand decision. 13. On 23 August 2001 the İzmir State Security Court Public Prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the İzmir State Security Court against the applicants and sixteen others, accusing them of being involved in the activities of an organised criminal gang, namely by bribing officials and threatening people. 14. On 17 September 2001 the first applicant filed a petition with the court, requesting his release. 15. On 17 October 2001 the applicants’ trial began at the İzmir State Security Court. At the end of the hearing, taking into consideration the seriousness of the offence and the evidence in the case file, the court ruled that the first applicant should be kept in detention on remand. 16. On 23 October 2001 the first applicant’s representative challenged the decision to continue to detain the first applicant on remand before the Istanbul State Security Court, via the registry of the Izmir State Security Court. He alleged that there was insufficient evidence to keep his client in detention. Upon the request of the Istanbul State Security Court, the public prosecutor submitted an opinion on 19 October 2001. 17. On 22 November 2001 the court refused the first applicant’s request for release. This decision was sent to the Registry of the İzmir State Security Court on 3 December 2001. 18. On 13 December 2001 the İzmir State Security Court held its second hearing and released the first applicant pending trial. 19. On 2 May 2002 the court sentenced the first applicant to five months’ imprisonment and acquitted the second applicant. 20. The fourth paragraph of Article 128 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (as amended by Law no. 3842/9 of 18 November 1992) provides that any person who has been arrested and/or in respect of whom a prosecutor has made an order for his or her continued detention may challenge that measure before the appropriate district judge and, if successful, be released. 21. Section 1 of Law no. 466 on the Payment of Compensation to Persons Unlawfully Arrested or Detained provides: “Compensation shall be paid by the State in respect of all damage sustained by persons: (1) who have been arrested, or detained under conditions or in circumstances incompatible with the Constitution or statute; (2) who have not been immediately informed of the reasons for their arrest or detention; (3) who have not been brought before a judicial officer after being arrested or detained within the time allowed by statute for that purpose; (4) who have been deprived of their liberty without a court order after the statutory time allowed for being brought before a judicial officer has expired; (5) whose close family have not been immediately informed of their arrest or detention; (6) who, after being arrested or detained in accordance with the law, are not subsequently committed for trial ..., or are acquitted or discharged after standing trial; or (7) who have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment shorter than the period spent in detention or ordered to pay a pecuniary penalty only...”",1,918

Savenkov, First Deputy Minister of Justice, and Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicants are victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster who live in the Rostov Region of Russia. Under domestic law they were entitled to social benefits. Because the authorities had failed to pay the benefits in full or in time, the applicants sought relief in courts of the Rostov Region. The courts held for the applicants, the judgments became binding, but their full enforcement was delayed. Details of the judgments are shown in the Annex.",0,139
1253,1253,"The applicants are Ursula Balmer-Schafroth, Ueli Balmer-Schafroth, Ursula Wanner and Rainer Zur Linde, all Swiss citizens who live in Wileroltigen and Detligen in Switzerland. They are represented before the Court by Mr Rainer Weibel, a lawyer practising in Bern. The applicants were among the ten applicants in the previous Balmer-Schafroth and Others v. Switzerland case (see judgment of 26 August 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV, pp. 1346 et seq.). The applicants live in the alarm zone 1 within a radius of between four and five kilometres from the nuclear power station at Mühleberg in Switzerland. On 14 December 1992, the Federal Council (Bundesrat) granted to the Mühleberg nuclear power station the operating licence for a limited period, i.e. until 31 December 2002. This decision of the Federal Council was contested before the Court and led to the judgment in the Balmer-Schafroth and Others case (cited above). In 1996 the company which operated the nuclear power station, the Bernische Kraftwerke AG, maintaining economic reasons, filed a request to cancel the limitation of the period of operation, and to obtain a licence for an unlimited period. The application was published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesblatt), whereupon 1,170 persons and four organisations filed objections thereto. The Federal Department of Transport and Energy (Eidgenössisches Verkehrs- und Energiewirtschaftsdepartement) then requested the Technical Examination Board TÜV, a German association, to examine in particular the relevance of certain cracks in the inner nuclear casing (Kernmantel) of the nuclear power station. In its expert opinion of 29 January 1998, numbering 178 pages, the TÜV concluded that the cracks endangered neither the possibility to turn off, or to cool, the reactor. The calculations of the growth in the cracks disclosed that in the coming years the security would only insignificantly be reduced. Moreover, the producer had considered all possible accident combinations. The report also noted that the control programs and methods were such that they could detect such cracks and determine their size, and to do so within a time-limit before the cracks became dangerous. Following this expert opinion, various persons applied to the Federal Council for a complete examination of all welded joints of the nuclear casing. The “Mühleberg association”, an association aiming at the closure of the Mühleberg nuclear power station, requested Mr C.K., a physicist, to comment on the TÜV expert opinion. In his reply, dated 30 April 1998, the expert C.K. concluded that the “size of the cracks may [have been] substantially underestimated”, and that so far the effects of the cracks in the nuclear casing upon the security of the nuclear power station had only insufficiently been examined. By decision of 28 October 1998 the Federal Council dismissed the various objections and prolonged the operating licence for a period of ten years, i.e. until 31 December 2012. The decision considered that due to various modernisations the Mühleberg nuclear power station had meanwhile become more secure than when it had been constructed. There were no defaults of a technical nature which would exclude a secure operation of the station. The Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate (Hauptabteilung für die Sicherheit der Kernanlagen) had given the go-ahead, and the TÜV expert opinion concluded that the cracks found did not impair the security. The decision also noted that the Federal Nuclear Energy Act (Atomgesetz) did not grant a right to an unlimited period of operation. In view of a popular consultative referendum in the Canton of Bern in 1992, in which the populace had in fact expressed itself against the Mühleberg nuclear power station, the Federal Council decided to grant a license for only a limited period of ten years. On 24 April 2000, the “Mühleberg association” wrote to the Federal Council, requesting a public hearing of the Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate as to the conditions for a possible closure of the Mühleberg power station. By letter dated 19 May 2000, Mr M. Leuenberger, a Federal Councillor (Bundesrat), refused the request. Annexed to the letter was a statement of the Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate dealing, inter alia, with the issue of an earthquake in the Mühleberg area. It was considered that the probability of damage to the nuclear reactor lay between (5-10)x10-6 per year, a figure based on all accidents of nuclear power stations of the world resulting from earthquakes, and that indeed, the Mühleberg nuclear power station had been constructed to withstand earthquakes. The probability of a plane crash on the nuclear power station was negligibly small. On 8 September 2000 the applicants filed with the Federal Council a request for reconsideration of its decisions of 14 December 1992 and 28 October 1998. Under Section 4 § 1 (a) of the 1959 Federal Nuclear Energy Act, a licence from the Confederation is required for the construction and operation of nuclear installations and for any changes in the purpose, nature or scale of such installations. Section 5 § 1 provides that a license must be refused or granted subject to appropriate conditions or obligations if that is necessary in order, in particular, to protect people, the property of others or important rights. Section 6 provides that the Federal Council or a body designated by it decides license applications. No appeal lies against its decisions. Section 8 stipulates that nuclear installations and every form of ownership of radioactive nuclear fuels and residues shall be placed under federal supervision; the Federal Council and the body designated by it shall have the right in executing their supervisory function to issue instructions at any time if that becomes necessary in order, in particular, to protect people, the property of others and important rights; they are also entitled to supervise compliance with these instructions. Under the Federal Court’s case-law, the safety of nuclear power plants can be considered by the Confederation only in the context of its licensing procedures (see judgments of the Federal Court (BGE [Bundesgerichtsentscheide] 119 Ia, p. 402).",0,979
1254,1254,"The applicant, Mr Vladimir Petrovich Korolev, is a Russian national who was born in 1954 and lives in Orenburg, in the Russian Federation. The applicant sued the Head of the Passport and Visa Department at the Regional Directorate of the Interior for having denied him access to documents pertaining to a delay in issuing his new travel passport. On 25 September 2001 the Verkh-Isetskiy District Court of Ekaterinburg dismissed the applicant’s claim. On 13 November 2001 the Sverdlovskiy Regional Court quashed the judgment on appeal and referred the case back to the District Court. On 16 April 2002 the District Court allowed the applicant’s claim, ordering the Head of the Passport and Visa Department to allow the applicant access to all the documents and materials relating to the issuing of his passport. The court also held that the Passport and Visa Department should pay the applicant 22.50 Russian roubles ((RUB) – less than one euro) in compensation for the court fees. On 4 July 2002 this judgment was upheld on appeal and became final. It is not evident from the case file if and when the respondent authority complied with the judgment in the part concerning the applicant’s access to his file. All reported actions taken by the applicant in the wake of the judgment were solely aimed at recovering the RUB 22.50 awarded by the District Court. On 22 July 2002 the District Court issued a writ of execution which was explicitly limited to the payment of the court’s award of RUB 22.50. On 28 April 2003 the bailiff initiated enforcement proceedings. On 15 December 2003 the applicant challenged the bailiff’s inactivity before the District Court. On 22 December 2003 the judge found the complaint to fall short of the procedural requirements and requested the applicant to comply therewith by 5 January 2004. The applicant was in particular requested to substantiate the bailiff’s alleged failure. The applicant supplemented his complaint on 31 December 2003. On 6 January 2004 the court found that the applicant had not complied with the said requirements and dismissed the complaint without considering its merits. On 10 February 2004 the Sverdlovskiy Regional Court upheld that decision.",0,361
1256,1256,"10. The Court is called upon to rule only on the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) in the present case. Thus, as regards the facts the Court will confine itself here to giving a brief outline and for the rest it refers to paragraphs 12 to 80 of its judgment of 16 July 1971. 11. That judgment concerned, inter alia, the detention of Ringeisen while on remand from 5 August to 23 December 1963, that is four months and eighteen days, and from 15 March 1965 to 20 March 1967, that is two years and five days. 12. Ringeisen’s lawyer wrote, on 23 July 1971, to the Austrian Federal Minister of Justice requesting him, with reference to the judgment of 16 July and to Articles 5 § 5 and 50 (art. 5-5, art. 50) of the Convention, to make proposals for the reparation of the damage allegedly sustained by the applicant. It was claimed that the applicant had, ""as a result of his unjustified detention"", suffered over and above the loss of his fortune irremediable damage to his health which reduced his life expectancy and made constant medical care necessary. The applicant’s lawyer therefore requested the Minister to advance on account the sum of 50,000 German marks (DM). In a reminder dated 2 August, he insisted that the matter should be dealt with promptly, having regard, in particular, to Ringeisen’s state of health. On 10 September 1971, the Minister replied that in view of his Ministry’s competence under the Constitution it was not in a position to deal with the matter. 13. Meanwhile, Ringeisen had addressed his request to the Commission on 18 August 1971. He laid emphasis on the fact that he was still in very difficult circumstances due to his poor state of health and he asked the Commission ""to apply to the ... Court ... on (his) behalf and to have a decision taken in accordance with Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention ..."". The applicant has set out more particulars of his claims in letters which he and his wife sent to the Commission on 24 November 1971, 10 December 1971, 21 January 1972 and 8 February 1972. He alleges that he has sustained considerable material damage resulting, inter alia, from interference with the conduct of his business and from loss of property and rents in Austria and for this he claims some 100 million Schillings. Furthermore, he states that he is entitled to compensation, in an amount which he leaves the Court to assess: for personal injury, for damage to his reputation and ""for detention"".",0,435

On 18 May 1993 the Balassagyarmat District Public Prosecutor's Office preferred a bill of indictment in the case, which concerned eleven other individuals. The applicant was charged with fraud and two counts of violating foreign exchange regulations. 7. Between 21 March 1995 and 4 February 2003, the Eger District Court held hearings over 79 days. It heard evidence from several experts and more than 100 witnesses. On the last-mentioned date, it acquitted the applicant. 8.

The Czech Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr V.A. Schorm, from the Ministry of Justice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 27 May 1991 a certain D. brought a civil action against the Racio cooperative, the applicant’s predecessor. By a judgment of 27 August 1991 the Břeclav District Court (okresní soud) dismissed D.’s action. On 14 February 1992 the Brno Regional Court (krajský soud) upheld this judgment. On an unspecified date in 1992 the applicant company joined the proceedings as one of successors of the Racio cooperative. On 17 January 1994 the Prague High Court (Vrchní soud), upon D.’s appeal on points of law (dovolání) quashed the judgments of the lower courts and sent the case back to the District Court for further consideration. On 11 February 1997 the District Court suspended the proceedings on the ground that other proceedings were pending before the same court which could have had an impact on the present proceedings. On 16 March 1998 the Regional Court quashed this decision and sent the case back to the District Court which, on 6 September 2000, again decided to suspend the proceedings. On 31 August 2001 the Regional Court quashed this decision. By a judgment of 9 April 2003 the District Court delivered a judgment on the merits of Mr D.’s action. On 20 April 2005 the Regional Court decided on the applicant company’s appeal. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the allegedly excessive length of judicial proceedings are set out in the Court’s decision in the case of Vokurka v.

1264,1264,"4. Between 5 July and 27 December 1991 the applicant worked as a manager of a joint stock company (“the employer”). On 7 February 1992 he was dismissed by the employer’s disciplinary commission, a decision which was confirmed by the executive board on 17 March 1992. 5. On 23 March 1992 the applicant brought an action against the employer to annul his dismissal and for his reinstatement as a manager. 6. On 16 June 1992 the then Štip Municipal Court (Општински Суд Штип) dismissed his claim. 7. On 25 January 1993 the then Štip District Court (Окружен Суд Штип) upheld his appeal of 19 November 1992 and remitted the case for a re-examination. 8. Of nine hearings scheduled before the first-instance court, none was adjourned at the applicant’s request. 9. On 29 December 1993 the then Municipal Court dismissed his claim. That decision was upheld by then District Court’s decision of 30 March 1994 dismissing his appeal of 10 February 1994. 10. On 30 May 1994 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law (ревизија) which was granted by the Supreme Court’s decision of 20 December 1995. On 22 February 1996 the then District Court again upheld the first-instance decision of 29 December 1993. 11. On 17 April 1996 the applicant submitted a fresh appeal on points of law before the Supreme Court. On 20 November 1997 the Supreme Court quashed both the first- and second-instance decisions and remitted the case for a renewed examination. It ruled that the lower courts had erroneously established that the employer’s meeting of shareholders (собрание на акционери) and the strike board (штрајкувачки одбор) had discharged the applicant as the employer’s manager prior to the disciplinary commission having given the dismissal decision (see paragraph 4 above). According to the minutes of their meeting of 27 December 1991, they had only voted against him, but had left the matter to be decided by the disciplinary commission. 12. On 29 May 1998 the applicant requested the removal of the first-instance judge for bias. On 3 June 1998 the President of the Štip Court of First Instance dismissed that request as unsubstantiated. 13. According to the information submitted by the parties, none of the six hearings fixed by the first-instance court was adjourned at the applicant’s request. 14. On 17 December 1998 the Štip Court of First Instance annulled the 1992 dismissal order finding that it was not given by an authorised body. However, it dismissed the applicant’s claim for his reinstatement to a post corresponding to his qualifications since bankruptcy proceedings had been meanwhile launched against the employer. The employer’s receiver (стечаен управник) could decide the reinstatement issue. 15. On 29 December 1999 the Court of Appeal quashed this decision as incoherent and ordered a retrial arguing that the lower court had erred in establishing the facts concerning the body competent to decide on the dismissal. 16. After three hearings being fixed, on 24 April 2001 the Štip Court of First Instance dismissed the applicant’s claims finding that: he was discharged as the employer’s manager by the executive board on 27 December 1991; under an application for disciplinary proceedings submitted by the strike board, the newly appointed manager requested the disciplinary commission to dismiss him for having committed serious work-related violations, which was actually done by the commission’s decision of 7 February 1992; and the executive board dismissed his objection by decision of 17 March 1992. The court therefore concluded that the applicant’s claims were ill-founded. This decision was given by another first-instance judge. On 29 November 2001 the Court of Appeal upheld this decision. 17. On 21 January 2002 the applicant submitted an appeal on points of law before the Supreme Court arguing that the lower courts had wrongly established and assessed the facts. 18. The applicant died on 31 October 2002. 19. On 11 September 2003 the Supreme Court finally dismissed his appeal finding that the lower courts had properly established the facts and correctly applied the national law. According to a note written on the slip receipt, on 3 December 2003 there was an unsuccessful attempt to serve this decision due to the applicant’s death. The applicant’s successors maintained that they learnt about this decision only on 29 July 2004 when they received the Government’s observations. The Government did not contest that assertion. 20. During the proceedings, the applicant applied several times to the first-instance court to expedite the proceedings. His requests for priority treatment submitted before the Supreme Court were refused. He also notified the State Judicial Council about the protracted length of the proceedings. 21. Section 10 of the then Civil Proceedings Act (Закон за парничната постапка) (“the Act”) provided that it was incumbent upon the court to undertake to conduct the proceedings without undue delay and economically, and to avoid any attempt of abuse of the rights afforded to the parties concerned. 22. Section 408 of the Act provided, inter alia, that the court should take into consideration the necessity of urgent settlement of employment disputes. 23. Section 36 of the Courts Act (Закон за судовите) of 2006 (“the 2006 Act”) provides that a party concerned can lodge with the immediate higher court (непосредно повисокиот суд) an application for the protection of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time if he/she considers that it has been violated by a court of competent jurisdiction. The immediate higher court considers the application (постапува по барањето) within six months after it has been lodged and decides whether the court below violated the right to a hearing within a reasonable time. The higher court shall award just satisfaction to the claimant if it finds a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time. The just satisfaction shall be paid from the State’s budget. The 2006 Act became applicable on 1 January 2007 (section 128).",1,975
1268,1268,"5. The applicants live in Nosivka, Chernihiv Region. The first applicant is Mr Volodymr Pozhyvotko’s widow and the second applicant is his mother. 6. In the evening of 12 October 2004 Mr Volodymyr Pozhvotko was shot dead in a local bar. 7. On the same date the Nosivskyy District Prosecutor’s Office opened an investigation in connection with the death. 8. During the night of 12-13 October 2004 an investigator from the prosecutor’s office, together with other law-enforcement officers, experts and witnesses, carried out an on-site examination, including photographing and videotaping of the crime scene. Certain material evidence was seized, including two pistols, cartridges, bullets and other items. The victim’s body was sent for a forensic medical examination. 9. In the subsequent period the investigative authorities ordered forensic examinations of the seized evidence, questioned a number of witnesses and conducted searches in order to find additional evidence. 10. On 18 October 2004 the first applicant was admitted to the proceedings as an aggrieved party. 11. On 9 November 2004 the investigator charged T. with murder and put him on the list of wanted persons. 12. On 7 February 2005 L. voluntarily confessed to shooting the victim dead. On the same day L. was arrested. The decisions concerning T. were revoked. 13. On 16 February 2005 L. was released on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to charge him with the crime. 14. On the same day the second applicant was granted the status of aggrieved party in the criminal proceedings. 15. By letter of 1 August 2005 the second applicant was informed that the case had been referred to the Chernihiv Regional Prosecutor’s Office for “a more qualified investigation”. 16. In its letter of 23 October 2005 the General Prosecutor’s Office informed the second applicant that the investigation had been delayed. They further noted that the Chernihiv Regional Prosecutor’s Office had been instructed to take comprehensive measures in the case. As regards her request for referral of the case to a different prosecutor’s office, she was informed that it would not be appropriate to do so. 17. On 1 November 2005 the investigator in charge of the case stated in writing that the video recording and photographs of the crime scene made on 12 October 2004 could not be found. 18. On 28 December 2005 the investigation was closed on the grounds that L. had acted in the state of necessary defence and the involvement of other individuals in the crime could not be established. 19. On 29 December 2005 the deputy prosecutor of the Chernihiv Region quashed that decision, noting that the dactylographic examination had not been completed and a number of witnesses had not been questioned. 20. On 20 March 2006, following the additional investigation, the case was closed once again on the grounds that L. had acted in the state of necessary defence, while the involvement of other individuals in the crime could not be established. 21. On 5 June 2006 the Novozavodskyy District Court of Chernihiv quashed that decision, finding that the investigation had not been comprehensive. It noted that there had been a significant number of investigative measures at the initial stage of the proceedings, including an on-site examination and forensic expert examinations, which had been carried out unprofessionally and in breach of procedural rules, and that the video recording and photographs of the crime scene could not be found. The court remitted the case for additional investigation, specifying, inter alia, that it was necessary to investigate the personality of the victim in more detail, establish the precise time of the crime, take measures to find the missing video recording and photographs, question witnesses, and conduct, if appropriate, additional expert examinations. 22. Following that decision, the investigation was renewed and conducted by the Chernihiv Regional Prosecutor’s Office. 23. In his letter of 24 May 2007 the Deputy Prosecutor of the Chernihiv Region informed the second applicant that the video recording of the crime scene had been found and a range of additional investigative measures had been undertaken. He indicated that the investigator of the Nosivskyy District Prosecutor’s Office should have been sanctioned for the inadequate investigation of the case, but he had been dismissed. 24. In August 2007 the case was referred to the Chernihiv Regional Police Department and in November 2008 it was referred to the Sumy Regional Police Department for further investigative measures. 25. On 12 November 2009 the police investigator terminated the proceedings on the grounds that L. had acted in the state of necessary defence. The applicants appealed against that decision. 26. On 15 November 2010 the Zarichnyy District Court of Sumy quashed that decision as unfounded and ordered further investigative measures. 27. In December 2010 and January 2011 the Sumy Regional Prosecutor’s Office gave instructions to the police investigator as to the further investigations to be carried out. Those instructions included, among other things, an additional examination of the crime scene, questioning of witnesses, a reconstruction of the crime, confrontations between witnesses, and additional expert examinations. 28. As of 25 April 2012 the proceedings were pending. 29. The applicants also instituted two sets of civil proceedings against the law-enforcement authorities, claiming that they had failed to investigate the case properly and had breached procedures during the investigation. The claims in the first set of proceedings were rejected. The applicants did not inform the Court of the outcome of the second set of proceedings. 30. The applicants also requested that an investigation be opened concerning the disappearance of the harvest of sunflower seeds which had allegedly belonged to Mr V. Pozhyvotko and had been entrusted to his business colleagues. The authorities refused to open an investigation, after finding that the matter was of a civil-law nature and that there was no evidence that Mr V. Pozhyvotko had ever owned the harvest in question. 31. The relevant domestic law can be found in the judgment of Muravskaya v. Ukraine (no. 249/03, §§ 35 and 36, 13 November 2008).",1,996
1270,1270,"5. The applicants were born in 1981 and 1961 respectively and lived in Diyarbakır. 6. On 5 May 1999 the applicants were laid off by the Diyarbakır Sur Municipality (“the Municipality”), with which they had been temporarily employed. 7. The applicants subsequently brought separate actions before the Diyarbakır Labour Court against the Municipality, claiming outstanding salaries, dismissal indemnities, severance pay and other pecuniary rights. 8. On 23 December and 11 November 1999, respectively, the labour court granted the applicants' request and ordered the payment of 324,681,000 Turkish liras (TRL) to the first applicant and TRL 927,531,000 to the second applicant, together with interest. In the absence of an appeal, these judgments became final on 3 January 2000 and 22 November 1999, respectively. 9. At the date of introduction of the applications, the judgment debts were still outstanding. However, in the meantime, friendly settlement agreements were reached between the applicants and the Municipality on 31 July 2008 and 10 February 2005, respectively, and the relevant payments were made to the applicants. 10. The relevant domestic law and practice in force at the material time are outlined in Ekici and Others v. Turkey (no. 28877/03, §§ 11-13, 23 September 2008).",1,198
1271,1271,"5. The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Otwock. 6. On an unspecified date in January 1987 the applicant's former husband instituted civil proceedings for division of matrimonial property. 7. During the proceedings the Otwock District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) decided on several occasions, of its own motion, to stay the proceedings due to the fact that the plaintiff had not paid the relevant costs arising in the course of the proceedings. 8. On numerous occasions the applicant requested the court to resume the proceedings and to proceed speedily with the claim. 9. On 5 March 1998 the applicant complained to the President of the Warsaw Regional Court (Prezes Sądu Wojewódzkiego) about the delay in the proceedings. 10. On 8 April 2004 the proceedings were resumed. 11. On 20 October 2006 the Otwock District Court gave a decision ordering the plaintiff to pay a certain amount to the applicant. The applicant appealed. 12. On 29 October 2007 the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) partly amended the first-instance decision and dismissed the remainder of the appeal. 13. On 15 February 2005 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Warsaw Regional Court under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”). 14. The applicant sought a ruling that the length of the proceedings before the Otwock District Court had been excessive and an award of just satisfaction in the amount of 10,000 Polish zlotys (PLN). 15. On 6 May 2005 the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed the applicant's complaint. It limited its examination of the lengthofproceedings issue to the period after the entry into force of the 2004 Act and stressed that the Act could not be applied to the protracted length of court proceedings occurring before that date. Having analysed the conduct of the District Court during the period after the entry into force of the 2004 Act (that is after 17 September 2004), the Regional Court found that there were no delays for which the District Court could be held responsible. It held that the proceedings had been conducted with due diligence and within a reasonable time. 16. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are set out in the Court's decisions in the cases of Charzyński v. Poland (no. 15212/03 (dec.), §§ 12-23, ECHR 2005-V) and Ratajczyk v. Poland (no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII) and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, (no. 61444/00, §§ 34-46, ECHR 2005-V).",1,453
1272,1272,"4. The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Patras. 5. On 20 October 2006 the applicant was arrested and criminal proceedings were brought against him for drug related offences. 6. After four adjournments - three on the court’s initiative and one on the request of the applicant - on 14 March 2008 the Athens First Instance Criminal Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to life imprisonment and a fine of 55,000 euros (judgment no. 1579/08). 7. On the same date the applicant lodged an appeal with the Athens Criminal Court of Appeal challenging the court’s findings and its evaluation of the evidence, which was scheduled for hearing on 1st October 2010. 8. After several adjournments the hearing of the appeal took place on 3 June 2011 and the applicant’s sentence was reduced to fourteen years of imprisonment. 9. There is no indication in the case file whether an appeal on points of law was lodged challenging the appellate judgment.",1,162
1276,1276,"4. The applicants were born 1966 and 1934 respectively, and live in Neryungri in the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic of the Russian Federation. 5. The applicants brought a civil action against the Government, seeking to enforce State promissory notes for purchase of a Russian-made car or to recover the monetary value thereof. 6. On 17 March 2003 the Ust-Yanskiy District Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic found for the applicants and awarded 112,441.80 Russian roubles (“RUR”) to the first applicant and RUR 107,327.82 to the second applicant against the Ministry of Finance. 7. On 23 April 2003 the Supreme Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic (hereinafter – “the Supreme Court”) rejected an appeal by the Ministry of Finance and upheld the judgment. 8. The enforcement proceedings were opened on 15 May 2003, but the judgment was not enforced. 9. By interim decision of 11 August 2003, Judge R. of the Supreme Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic refused a request by the Ministry of Finance for obtaining the case file for the purpose of initiating supervisory-review proceedings. The Ministry had claimed that the courts had incorrectly applied the substantive law. 10. By letter of 20 October 2003, the Supreme Court's President rejected a renewed request by the Ministry of Finance for launching the supervisory-review proceedings. 11. On 9 June 2004 the Ministry of Finance introduced a new application for supervisory review of the judgments in the applicants' favour, founded on the same grounds as before. 12. On 30 September 2004 the Supreme Court's President issued an interim decision on remitting the applicants' cases for examination on the merits to the Supreme Court's Presidium by way of supervisory review. In the procedural part, the interim decision of 11 August 2003, but not the letter of 20 October 2003, was mentioned. 13. On 14 October 2004 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic, in a five-judge formation presided over by the Supreme Court's President, found that the lower courts had not taken into account certain provisions relating to reimbursement of State promissory notes. On that ground, relying on Articles 388 and 390 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Presidium quashed the judgments in the applicants' favour and dismissed their claim as having no basis in the domestic law. 14. A judicial decision becomes legally binding after the appeal court has examined the matter (Article 209 § 1). A judicial decision must be enforced once it became legally binding, unless the law provides for its immediate enforcement (Article 210). 15. The relevant provisions governing the supervisory-review proceedings read as follows: “1. Courts may issue judicial decisions in the form of judicial orders, judgments and interim decisions...” “1. Judicial decisions that have become legally binding, with the exception for judicial decisions by the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, may be appealed against... to a court exercising supervisory review, by parties to the case and by other persons whose rights or legal interests have been adversely affected by these judicial decisions. 2. Judicial decisions may be appealed against to a court exercising supervisory review within one year after they became legally binding...” “An application for supervisory review must contain: (1) the name of the court to which it is addressed; ... (4) a reference to the first-instance, appeal or cassation courts that examined the case and a summary of their decisions; (5) a reference to the judgment or decision which is being appealed against...” “2. Having examined an application for supervisory review, the judge issues an interim decision on – (1) obtaining the case file if there exist doubts as to the lawfulness of the judicial decision; (2) refusing to obtain the case file if the arguments in the application for supervisory review may not, in accordance with the federal law, result in quashing of the judicial decision. ... 6. The President of the regional Supreme Court... may disagree with the judge's decision refusing to obtain the case file. In such case the President issues his own decision on obtaining the case file.” “2. Having examined the case file obtained by the supervisory-review court, the judge issues an interim decision on – – refusing to remit the case for examination on the merits by the supervisory-review court; – remitting the case for examination of the application for supervisory review on the merits by the supervisory-review court.” “2. The President of the regional Supreme Court... may disagree with the judge's decision refusing to remit the case for examination on the merits by the supervisory-review court. In such case the President issues his own decision on remitting the case for examination on the merits by the supervisory-review court.” “1. A judicial decision on remitting the case for examination on the merits by a supervisory-review court must contain: (7) a reasoned description of the grounds for remitting the case for examination on the merits...” “1. Having examined the case by way of supervisory review, the court may ... (5) quash or alter the judicial decision issued by a court of first, second or supervisory-review instance and issue a new judicial decision, without remitting the matter for a fresh examination, if substantive legal provisions have been erroneously applied or interpreted.” 16. Once instituted, enforcement proceedings must be completed within two months upon receipt of the writ of execution by the bailiff (Section 13).",1,892
1278,1278,"4. The applicants were born in 1967, 1959 and 1970, respectively. All three live in Kyiv. 5. On 26 June 1996 criminal proceedings against the applicants were instituted. 6. On 31 June 1996 A.D. was arrested on suspicion of fraud and theft. On 16 August 1996 V.S. and, on 19 August 1996 A.A., were arrested on similar charges. The prosecution’s case was that the applicants had fraudulently (using false documents) converted and subsequently sold an apartment belonging to Mr K. 7. During the investigation the prosecution authorities obtained several economic expert opinions regarding the suspect transaction. 8. On 3 March 1997 the Kyiv City Prosecutor approved the indictment and referred the case to the Kyiv City Court, requesting it to determine the territorial jurisdiction in the case. On 5 March 1997 the Kyiv City Court (hereafter “City Court”) remitted the case to the Shevchenkovsky District Court of Kyiv (hereafter “the District Court”). The applicants stood trial on charges of theft, fraud, and embezzlement of official documents (A.D.), fraud and forgery (V.S.) and fraud and theft (A.A.). 9. On 2 April 1997 the District Court committed the applicants for trial. 10. On 3 April 1997 the District Court released A.A. and V.S. on bail of UAH 3,000 each (approximately USD 1,500 at the material time) and an undertaking not to abscond. On 19 May 1997 A.D. was also released on bail of UAH 4,000 (approximately USD 2,000) and an undertaking not to abscond. On 27 May 1997 the applicants’ bail was raised to UAH 17,000 (approximately USD 8,500) each. 11. Between April 1997 and June 1998 the District Court listed 22 hearings (14 between September 1997 and June 1998). Ten hearings were adjourned mainly due to the failure of the victim, witnesses and the applicants’ lawyers to appear in court. In the course of the proceedings on 24 October 1997 the court issued a compulsory summons for the witness F. 12. On 22 June 1998 the District Court decided to remit the case for further inquiries on account of the insufficiency of the original investigation. The court stated inter alia, that the investigative authorities had failed to establish the whereabouts of one of the key witnesses, F., which made it impossible for the court to summon her to give evidence. The prosecution appealed against this decision. The decision was, apart from one point, quashed by the City Court in its ruling of 6 August 1998 because the flaws in the investigation indicated in this decision could be remedied during the trial. However, the City Court upheld the findings of the District Court that the charges of aggravated embezzlement filed against A.D. needed additional investigation. 13. The trial resumed on 2 November 1998. During the period November 1998 to April 2000 thirty hearings were scheduled, of which seven were held. Fifteen hearings were cancelled due to the victim’s failure to appear, five hearings were adjourned on account of the applicants’ absence and on two occasions the presiding judge was ill. In particular, the hearing scheduled for 12 May 2000 was adjourned until 17 May 1999 on account of V.S. being on a mission. On 15 March 2000 he lodged with the trial court a successful request for permission to go to the Russian Federation for medical treatment. 14. On 20 April 2000 the District Court remitted the case for further investigation, referring to the similar circumstances in its decision of 22 June 1998. The prosecution’s appeal out of time was rejected by the City Court on 28 September 2000. On 18 January 2001 the Kyiv City Prosecutor lodged a supervisory protest (an extraordinary appeal) against the decision 20 April 2000. On 29 January 2001 the Presidium of the City Court granted the protest and remitted the case to the first instance court for further consideration. 15. The District Court resumed the examination of the case on 4 April 2001. Between April 2001 and July 2002 the court listed 23 hearings of which 13 were adjourned due to the failure of the victim (on 9 occasions), the applicants (on 3 occasions) and the prosecutor (on one occasion) to appear. In the course of the proceedings on 24 April and 21 May 2001 the court ordered the compulsory summons of the victim. 16. On 17 July 2002 the District Court disjoined the proceedings concerning the charges of theft and embezzlement of documents (A.D. and A.A.) and remitted the case in this part for additional investigation. 17. On 19 July 2002 the District Court terminated proceedings concerning the charges of fraud (all three applicants), embezzlement of documents (A.D.) and forgery (V.S.) as time-barred, lifted the bail condition and ordered the return of the bail money. 18. According to both parties’ submissions, the criminal proceedings for (presumably) theft against A.D. and A.A. are still pending. 19. The text of Articles 148, 149 and 150 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1960 (general rules on the application of preventive measures) is set out in Merit v. Ukraine, no. 66561/01, 30 March 2004 (Relevant domestic law and practice). 20. Article 154-1 of the Code (application of bail) is set out in Koval v. Ukraine (no. 65550/01, 10 December 2002). 21. Article 281 (remittal of a case for additional investigation) is set out in the judgment of 6 September 2005 in the case of Salov v. Ukraine (see no. 65518/01, § 72). 22. Article 151 of the Code provides that an undertaking not to abscond consists in obtaining from the suspect or the accused an agreement not to leave the place of residence or temporary stay without the permission of an investigator (or a trial judge). In the event of a breach of the written undertaking given by him, a stricter measure of restraint may be applied to the suspect or accused.",1,964
1282,1282,"4. The applicants were both born in 1940 and live in Florence. 5. They are the owners of a flat in Florence, which they had let to A.Q. 6. In a writ served on the tenant on 14 September 1984, the applicants informed him of their intention to terminate the lease on expiry of the term on 31 December 1987 and summoned him to appear before the Florence Magistrate. 7. By a decision of 14 November 1984, which was made enforceable on the same day, the Florence Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 31 December 1988. 8. In the meanwhile the tenant died and his wife refused to leave the premises. 9. On 25 September 1989, the applicants made a statutory declaration that they urgently required the premises as accommodation for their son. 10. On 16 November 1989, the applicants served notice on the tenant requiring her to vacate the premises. 11. On 6 December 1989, they served notice on the tenant informing her that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 31 January 1990. 12. Between 31 January 1990 and 8 February 2001, the bailiff made twenty-one attempts to recover possession. Each attempt proved unsuccessful, as the applicants were never granted the assistance of the police in enforcing the order for possession. 13. In the meanwhile, on 1 December 1998, the applicants made a second statutory declaration that they urgently required the premises as accommodation for their son. 14. Pursuant to section 6 of Law no. 431/98, on 9 July 1999, the tenant asked for a suspension of the enforcement proceedings. The Florence Magistrate suspended the proceedings until 8 February 2001. 15. On 9 March 2001, the applicants recovered possession of the flat. 16. Since 1947 the public authorities in Italy have frequently intervened in residential tenancy legislation with the aim of controlling rents. This has been achieved by rent freezes (occasionally relaxed when the Government decreed statutory increases), by the statutory extension of all current leases and by the postponement, suspension or staggering of the enforcement of orders for possession. The relevant domestic law concerning the extension of tenancies, the suspension of enforcement and the staggering of evictions is described in the Court’s judgment in the case of Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, §§ 18-35, ECHR 1999-V. 17. As regards the control of the rents, the evolution of the Italian legislation may be summarised as follows. 18. The first relevant measure was the Law no. 392 of 27 July 1978 which provided machinery for “fair rents” (the so-called equo canone) on the basis of a number of criteria such as the surface of the flat and its costs of realisation. 19. The second step of the Italian authorities dated August 1992. It was taken in the view of progressive liberalisation of the market of tenancies. Accordingly, a legislation relaxing on rent levels restrictions (the so-called patti in deroga) entered into force. Owners and tenants were in principle given the opportunity to derogate from the rent imposed by law and to agree on a different price. 20. Lastly, Law no. 431 of 9 December 1998 reformed the tenancies and liberalised the rents. 21. The tenant is under a general obligation to refund the owner any damages caused in the case of late restitution of the flat. In this regard, Article 1591 of the Italian Civil Code provides: “The tenant who fails to vacate the immovable property is under an obligation to pay the owner the agreed amount until the date when he leaves, together with other remaining damages”. 22. However, Law no. 61 of 1989 set out, inter alia, a limit to the compensation claimable by the owner entitling him to a sum equal to the rent paid by the tenant at the time of the expiration of the lease, proportionally increased according to the cost of living (Article 24 of Law no. 392 of 27 July 1978) plus 20%, along the period of inability to dispose of the possession of the flat. 23. In the judgment no. 482 of 2000, the Constitutional Court was called upon to decide whether such a limitation complied with the Constitution. The Constitutional Court held that it was compatible with the Constitution with regard to periods of time during which the suspension of the evictions was determined by law. The Constitutional Court explained that the introduction of that limitation was intended to settle the tenancies of the time of the emergency legislation, when the housing shortage made the suspension of the enforcement necessary. While evictions were suspended ex lege, the law predetermined the quantum of the reimbursement chargeable to the tenant, both measures being temporary and exceptional. Besides, the interests of the owner were counterbalanced by the exemption for him from the burden to prove the damages. 24. The Constitutional Court declared the limitation to the compensation claimable by the owner unconstitutional with regard to cases where the impossibility for the owner to repossess the flat depended on the conduct of the tenant and was not due to a legislative intervention. Accordingly, it opened the way to owners for the institution of civil proceedings in order to obtain full reparation of the damages caused by the tenant.",1,881
1283,1283,"The applicant is an Austrian national, born in 1939 and living in Köflach. She is represented before the Court by Mr Peter Bartl, a lawyer practising in Graz. A. On 12 and 13 December 1989 criminal proceedings were opened against the applicant and her husband, H.S., respectively, on suspicion of their having brought into circulation large amounts of narcotic drugs (Inverkehrsetzen grosser Mengen Suchtgift). On 13 August 1990 the investigating judge discontinued the proceedings against the applicant. He noted that the applicant had denied being involved in any criminal act. As H.S. had availed himself of the right not to give evidence against his wife (Zeugenentschlagungsrecht), it was unlikely that the applicant’s defence would be disproved. On 6 March 1991 the Munich Regional Court convicted H.S. amongst others of the above charges. In its reasoning, the court, referring to statements made by H.S., noted several times that the applicant had contributed to the commission of the offence at issue. Having regard to the above judgment, the Graz Public Prosecutor’s Office (Staatsanwaltschaft) requested the re-opening of the proceedings against the applicant on 8 January 1992. The Public Prosecutor’s Office noted that H.S. had previously availed himself of the right not to give evidence against his wife. His statements in the proceedings before the Munich Regional Court therefore constituted new evidence. On 11 March 1992 the Review Chamber (Ratskammer) of the Graz Regional Criminal Court (Landesgericht für Strafsachen) granted the re-opening request. On 24 July 1992 the applicant was arrested. Subsequently, the investigating judge ordered her detention on remand, finding that there was a suspicion of her having committed the above offence, as well as a danger of absconding. On 6 August 1992 she was released on bail. On 29 October 1992 the Graz Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) quashed the order to re-open the proceedings and referred the case back to the Graz Regional Criminal Court. It found that the latter should have carried out further investigations into the precise contents of H.S.’s statements before the Munich Regional Court. On 16 February 1994 the Review Chamber of the Graz Regional Court again decided to re-open the proceedings. The applicant’s appeal against this decision was dismissed by the Graz Court of Appeal on 13 April 1994. She was finally acquitted on 31 August 1995. On 12 September 1995 the applicant filed an action claiming compensation for unlawful detention under section 2 § 1 (a) of the Compensation (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1969 (Strafrechtliches Entschädigungsgesetz). She argued that her detention between 24 July 1992 and 6 August 1992 had been unlawful as she had been arrested before the order to re-open the criminal proceedings had become final. On 19 December 1995 the Graz Court of Appeal granted the applicant’s action, finding that she was entitled to compensation. It held that, as a general rule, arrest and detention of a suspect could lawfully be ordered even before the re-opening order became final as the appeal against it had no suspensive effect. The investigating judge was bound by the order to reopen the proceedings. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal noted that, at the time the applicant’s detention was ordered, there was a reasonable suspicion against her as H.S. had incriminated her in the proceedings before the Munich Regional Court. Having regard to the sentence she risked incurring, namely one to fifteen years’ imprisonment, and to the fact that she was unemployed at that time and not well integrated in society, the court also found that at that time a danger of absconding had properly been assumed by the investigating judge. However, it followed from the decision of 29 October 1992 that the order to re-open the proceedings had been premature and therefore unlawful. The court accordingly concluded that the applicant’s detention, being based on that defective order, had likewise been unlawful. On 18 April 1996 the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof) allowed the appeal of the Public Prosecutor’s Office and dismissed the applicant’s action. It noted that the order to re-open proceedings which had been discontinued meant that they were resumed at the stage of the preliminary investigation. The re-opening order served as a legal basis for the continuation of the proceedings and also for the suspect’s arrest and detention, even before it became final, as the appeal against it did not have suspensive effect. The investigating judge was bound by that order and had no competence to review its lawfulness. The fact that, in the present case, the order had later been quashed by the appellate court did not retrospectively render unlawful the applicant’s detention, which had duly been based on a reasonable suspicion and the danger of absconding. The decision was served on 22 May 1996. B. Relevant domestic law The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung), in the version in force in 1992, provided as follows: According to section 352, the Review Chamber of the competent criminal court could, upon the Public Prosecutor’s request, re-open proceedings against a specific suspect which had been discontinued, if criminal liability for the offence had not become statute-barred and new evidence was adduced which appeared likely to lead to the suspect’s conviction (paragraph 1). An appeal against the Review Chamber’s decision could be lodged with the Court of Appeal (paragraph 2). As section 352 was silent on the question whether or not such an appeal had suspensive effect, the general rule laid down in section 114 § 2 applied, namely that an appeal against the decision of the Review Chamber had no suspensive effect.",0,918
1284,1284,"The applicant, Mrs Liana Nazaretian, is a Georgian national who was born in 1959 and lives in Tbilisi. She was represented before the Court by Mr Malkhaz Labadze, a lawyer practising in Tbilisi. The Georgian Government (“the Government”) were successively represented by their Agents, Mr David Tomadze and Mr Levan Meskhoradze of the Ministry of Justice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In a judgment of 8 July 1999 the Gldani-Nadzaladevi District Court in Tbilisi ordered that a monthly allowance be paid to the applicant by her former spouse until their child, born in 1993, reached the age of majority. That judgment became binding on 10 August 1999. As disclosed by the case file, since the debtor failed to comply with this judgment, the applicant obtained a writ of execution from the GldaniNadzaladevi District Court and requested, on an unspecified date, the initiation of enforcement proceedings. The bailiffs, resorting to a number of forcible measures, retrieved from the debtor the child allowance for approximately ten months. As further disclosed by the case file, on 2 May 2001 the applicant requested, for unspecified reasons, the discontinuation of the enforcement proceedings. According to a receipt paper signed by the applicant on the same day, the bailiff handed to her all the case materials, including the enforcement writ. On 20 June 2001 the applicant, claiming that her former spouse had a higher income than that acknowledged in the judgment of 8 July 1999, requested that the allowance be increased (“the second set of child allowance proceedings”). Her claim was found to be unsubstantiated by several instances, and, lastly, by the Supreme Court of Georgia on 8 October 2004. Subsequent to the termination of the second set of child allowance proceedings, the applicant requested, either in October or November 2004, the bailiffs to proceed with the enforcement of the judgment of 8 July 1999. The Enforcement Department of the Ministry of Justice (“the Enforcement Department”) replied in late November 2004, reminding the applicant of the fact that the enforcement proceedings had been discontinued at her request. If she wished to have those proceedings re-opened, she had to re-submit the relevant writ of execution, as required by section 20 § 1 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act of 16 April 1999 (“the Enforcement Act”). Pursuant to the applicant’s request, the Gldani-Nadzaladevi District Court issued, on 24 January 2005, another writ of execution for the judgment of 8 July 1999, and on 31 January 2005 the enforcement proceedings were formally reopened. However, since the writ of 24 January 2005 indicated an invalid address for the debtor, the bailiff sent the document back to the applicant on 7 April 2006 unenforced. On 22 June 2005 the Enforcement Department, acting in reply to the General Prosecutor Office’s enquiry about the cause of non-enforcement, reminded the applicant of her obligation to provide an enforcement writ with the debtor’s correct address, without which information no enforcement measures could be undertaken. Section 5 § 1 “Bailiffs at Enforcement Offices [of the Ministry of Justice] shall be responsible for the execution of the decisions provided for hereunder.” Section 17 § 5 “Bailiffs shall take all lawful measures available in order to secure the speedy and effective enforcement of decisions, to explain to parties their rights and responsibilities, and to assist in the protection of their rights and legal interests.” Pursuant to section 18 §§ 1 and 2, an appeal against any procedural decision, action or omission of the bailiff lay to a court. Section 20 § 1 stated that enforcement proceedings could not be launched without the relevant writ of execution. Pursuant to section 37, the reasonableness of the decision to discontinue the enforcement proceedings could be reviewed by a court at the creditor’s request. Pursuant to Articles 207-209, the State could be sued for the harm done by action or omission of any public servant as well as by the implementation of a lawfully issued legal-administrative act. In such proceedings, the relevant provisions of the Civil Code could be applied, if necessary. Pursuant to Article 1005 § 1, damage done to an individual by either negligent or deliberate misconduct of a public servant should be compensated by the State.",0,706
1287,1287,"4. In 1972 the State Treasury transferred to the applicants a property situated in Krosno. There was no adequate access by road to the property at that time, but the State authorities declared that an access road would soon be constructed. However, the authorities did not undertake any action to ensure proper access to the applicants' property. In particular, a right of way through neighbouring properties was never created. 5. In 1983 the applicants brought a civil action to have a right of way established by way of a judicial decision. On 31 December 1986 the Krosno District Court allowed their request. Their neighbours appealed. 6. On 27 October 1987 the Krosno Regional Court quashed the judgment of the firstinstance court and remitted the case for reexamination, finding that the first-instance court had failed to assess the evidence properly. 7. By a judgment of 23 October 1990 the Krosno District Court again granted a right of way to the applicants. The neighbours brought a new appeal. On 20 June 1991 the Krosno Regional Court quashed the contested judgment and again remitted the case for re-examination. 8. On 3 November 1997 the Krosno District Court allowed the applicants' claim. The Krosno Regional Court dismissed the neighbours' appeal on 6 October 1998. The neighbours brought a cassation appeal before the Supreme Court. 9. The Supreme Court refused to entertain their appeal on 22 June 2001. This decision was served on the applicants on 13 September 2001. 10. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”), are stated in the Court's decisions in the cases of Charzyński v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), §§ 1223, ECHR 2005V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005VIII and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, §§ 3446, ECHR 2005V. 11. In particular, section 18 of the 2004 Act lays down the following transitional rules in relation to applications already pending before the Court: “1. Within six months after the date of entry into force of this law persons who, before that date, had lodged a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights ... complaining of a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time guaranteed by Article 6 (1) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ..., may lodge a complaint about the unreasonable length of the proceedings on the basis of the provisions of this law if their complaint to the Court had been lodged in the course of the impugned proceedings and if the Court has not adopted a decision concerning the admissibility of their case. 2. A complaint lodged under subsection 1 shall indicate the date on which the application was lodged with the Court. 3. The relevant court shall immediately inform the Minister of Foreign Affairs of any complaints lodged under subsection 1.”",1,528
1292,1292,"6. The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Plovdiv. 7. On 27 July 1993 the applicant, who was a taxi driver, hit a pedestrian with his car. The applicant brought the victim to the nearest hospital, where he died several days later despite the efforts of the medical doctors. 8. On 4 August 1993 or 20 October 1993 the applicant was charged with involuntary manslaughter. 9. On an unspecified date in the beginning of 1994, after the completion of the investigation, an indictment was submitted to the Plovdiv Regional Court. The relatives of the victim joined the proceedings as civil plaintiffs. 10. After a hearing, on 18 March 1994 the court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to one year's imprisonment, suspended. The court also ordered the suspension of the applicant's driving licence for two years and ordered him to pay damages to the relatives of the victim. 11. Upon the applicant's appeal, on 10 June 1994 the Supreme Court quashed the lower court's judgment and referred the case back for reexamination at the investigation stage, instructing the competent authorities to commission a new expert report in order to clarify certain additional facts. 12. The renewed investigation lasted until 5 December 1995 when a fresh indictment was submitted to the Plovdiv Regional Court. 13. By judgment of 3 June 1997 the Regional Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to one year's imprisonment, suspended. The court also ordered the suspension of the applicant's driving licence for one year. 14. On 10 June 1997 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Court of Cassation. 15. On 14 November 1997 the Supreme Court of Cassation, acting as a court of appeal in a chamber of three judges, dismissed the appeal. 16. On 6 May 1998 the applicant filed with the Plovdiv Regional Court a petition for review (cassation), which would have fallen to be examined by a five-member chamber of the Supreme Court of Cassation in the transitional period following the 1998 legislative amendments (see paragraph 20 below). 17. On an unspecified date the Plovdiv Regional Court transmitted the petition and the case file to the Supreme Court of Cassation. 18. On 24 March 1999 a judge of the Supreme Court of Cassation dismissed as time-barred the petition for review (cassation) and ordered the return of the case file back to the Regional Court. The order was made on a standard form which stated that the petition for review had been dismissed as time-barred, without mentioning any dates. The name of the judge who issued the order was not indicated. 19. In accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure and the practice, appeals are filed with the registry of the court whose decision is being appealed against. That court then transmits the appeal, together with the case-file, to the higher court in which the power to examine the appeal is vested. 20. By amendment of the Code of Criminal Procedure published on 20 February 1998 and in force as of 1 April 1998, the system of appeals against convictions and sentences was reformed. In accordance with section 37 § 2 of the transitory provisions to the Act amending the Code of Criminal Procedure, the timelimit for submission of a petition for review (cassation) against judgments delivered prior to the amendment's entry into force was six months from the date on which the judgment had become enforceable. Under Article 371 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as in force at the relevant time, appellate judgments upholding the first instance judgment became enforceable on the date of delivery.",1,597
1294,1294,"6. On 9 September 1993 the Bielsko-Biała Regional Court dismissed the applicant's request for registration of the title of a periodical, The Social and Political Monthly – A European Moral Tribunal (Miesięcznik społeczno-polityczny, europejski sąd moralny) to be published in Kęty. The court considered that in accordance with the Press Act and the Ordinance of the Minister of Justice on the registration of periodicals, the name of a periodical should be relevant to its contents. The name as proposed by the applicant would suggest that a European institution had been established in Kęty, which was untrue and would be misleading to prospective buyers. Moreover, the proposed title would be disproportionate to the periodical's actual importance and readership as it was hardly conceivable that a periodical of a European dimension could be published in Kęty. The court went on to state: “... the applicant stubbornly applies for registration of periodicals the titles of which would suggest the existence in Kęty of an institution of international character (such as the European Moral Tribunal or the World Tribunal of Morality), and when requested by the court to change the titles he declares that he will not do so.” 7. On 17 December 1993 the Katowice Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicant against this decision. The court stated, inter alia, that in the proceedings before the first-instance court the applicant had been requested to change the proposed title by deleting the term “European Moral Tribunal”, but he had refused to do so. 8. Subsequently, the applicant made a number of further applications for the registration of periodicals. He succeeded in obtaining four registrations. 9. On 6 May 1994 the Minister of Justice refused to grant leave for an extraordinary appeal against the decision of 17 December 1993, finding that it was in accordance with the law. 10. On 17 February 1994 the Bielsko-Biała Regional Court dismissed a new request by the applicant for registration of a periodical, Germany – A thousand-year-old enemy of Poland. The court noted that at a hearing on 17 February 1994 the applicant, when requested to change the proposed title so as to remove its negative character, had refused to do so. The court considered that registration of the periodical with the proposed title would be harmful to Polish-German reconciliation and detrimental to good cross-border relations. 11. The applicant appealed against this decision, submitting that it was incomprehensible and amounted to censorship. 12. On 12 April 1994 the Katowice Court of Appeal upheld the contested decision. The court observed that the title, as proposed by the applicant, suggested that the proposed periodical would concentrate unduly on negative aspects of Polish-German relations. The court considered that such a title would be in conflict with reality in that it would give an unbalanced picture of the relevant facts. The court further considered that the lower court had been justified in refusing registration on the ground that the title would be detrimental to Polish-German reconciliation and to good relations between Poland and Germany. 13. Section 20 of the Press Act of 26 January 1984 requires registration of a press title by the regional court as a prerequisite for publication of a periodical. A request for registration should contain the proposed title, the editor's address, the name of the editor-in-chief and other personal data, the name and address of the publishing house and information on how often the periodical would be published. The decision on registration is to be taken within thirty days of the date on which the request has been filed with the court. The court must refuse registration if the request does not contain the required information or if the proposed title would prejudice a right to protection of the title of any existing periodical. Section 45 of the Press Act provides that a person who publishes a periodical without the required registration is liable to a fine. 14. Section 23(a) of the Press Act authorises the Minister of Justice to issue an ordinance specifying the manner in which the press register should be run. 15. Section 5 of the Ordinance of the Minister of Justice on the registration of periodicals, as applicable at the material time, provided that registration was not possible if it would be “inconsistent with the regulations in force and with the real state of affairs” (“niezgodny z przepisami prawa lub z istniejącym stanem rzecz”). 16. On 1 November 1997 the ordinance was amended in that section 5 was deleted.",1,746
1297,1297,"4. The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Siirt. 5. On 20 December 1990 the General Directorate of National Roads and Highways expropriated three plots of land belonging to the applicant. A committee of experts assessed the value of the plots of land and the relevant amount was paid to him. 6. Following the applicant's request for increased compensation, on 8 September 1998 the Baykan Civil Court of First-instance awarded him additional compensation of 114,180,000 Turkish liras (TRL), plus interest at the statutory rate applicable at the date of the court's decision. In order to calculate the amount of increased compensation, the court consulted several experts. 7. The General Directorate of National Roads and Highways appealed against the judgment of 8 September 1998. 8. On 19 October 1998 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment. 9. According to the order of the General Directorate of National Roads and Highways, the amount of TRL 248,595,000 was paid to the applicant on 22 December 1998. The applicant claimed that he was paid on 4 January 1999. 10. The relevant domestic law and practice are set out in the Aka v. Turkey judgment of 23 September 1998 (Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VI, pp. 2674-76, §§ 17-25).",0,206
1302,1302,"The applicant, Osman Kinsiz, is a Turkish national, who was born in 1949 and lives in Istanbul. He was represented before the Court by Mr Kocak, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In 1992, the General Directorate of National Roads and Highways (Devlet Karayolları Genel Müdürlüğü), a state body responsible, inter alia, for motorway construction, expropriated a plot of land belonging to the applicant in Istanbul. A committee of experts assessed the value of the plot of land and this amount was paid to the applicant when the expropriation took place. On 22 October 1996, following the applicant’s request for increased compensation, the Pendik Civil Court of General Jurisdiction awarded him an additional compensation of 451,254,848 Turkish liras (TRL) plus an interest at the statutory rate of 30% per annum. On 31 March 1998 the Court of Cassation upheld the decision of the first-instance court. The due amount which was 837,196,000 Turkish liras (TRL) including the interest, was paid to the applicant on 26 May 1998. Under Law no. 3095 of 4 December 1984 the rate of interest on overdue State debts was set at 30% per annum. As of 1 January 1998 the statutory rate of interest was increased to 50%. The statutory rate of interest was set at the compound interest rate, namely 60% as of 1 January 2000. A description of further relevant domestic law may be found in the Aka v. Turkey, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VI, §§ 17-25; Akkuş v. Turkey, judgment of 9 July 1997, Reports 1997-IV, §§ 13-16.",0,275
1307,1307,"The applicant is a Peruvian national born in 1937. He is represented before the Court by Ms A.E.M. Röttgering, a lawyer practising in Amsterdam. The applicant is a retired senior diplomat. At the time of the events complained of he had no diplomatic status. On 27 April 1997, while in transit from Peru to Spain and travelling on two passports (one ordinary, the other a diplomatic one containing a Schengen visa), he was arrested at Amsterdam (Schiphol) airport after customs found a quantity of cocaine in excess of 23 kilograms in his luggage. The applicant was also found to be carrying a large sum of money in cash. The cocaine had been packed in parcels secured with adhesive tape. It appears from police reports that adhesive tape with which the applicant’s luggage had been secured was identical to that used for packing the cocaine. The applicant relinquished title to the cocaine and the packaging materials (including the tape), and these were destroyed. The applicant was tried by the Regional Court (Arrondissementsrechtbank) of Haarlem, which on 14 August 1997 found him guilty of having intentionally imported cocaine and sentenced him to four years’ imprisonment. The applicant appealed. The appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal (Gerechtshof) of Amsterdam on 17 December 1997. The appeal was by way of a complete rehearing, as is prescribed by Netherlands law. The applicant admitted before the Court of Appeal that before leaving Lima he had packed his luggage himself and secured it with adhesive tape. He had handed it to a luggage porter who had checked it in for him. The cocaine had been put into his luggage by persons unknown to him after the luggage had been checked in. The large sum of money was intended to set up a business in Spain. The defence asked for the adhesive tape with which the cocaine had been packed to be examined for fingerprints, arguing that the absence of the applicant’s fingerprints would prove that the applicant had not handled the cocaine. This request could not be acceded to as the tape had been destroyed after the applicant had relinquished title to it. The defence then suggested that the prosecution be declared inadmissible on this ground. The defence further stated that persons unknown to the applicant had placed the cocaine in his luggage. It was suggested that this might conceivably have been the work of the Peruvian secret service, and a Ministry of Justice liaison officer should be detailed to make examinations in South America. In its judgment, which was delivered on 29 December 1997, the Court of Appeal held that it had normally to be assumed that a person who packed his own luggage was aware of its contents; although admittedly in certain circumstances this might not be so there was nothing to suggest in the present case that such circumstances were present. As to the adhesive tape, even if the absence of the applicant’s fingerprints could be established that would not affect the Court of Appeal’s finding that the applicant must have known that his luggage contained cocaine. As to the possibility that the applicant had been framed by the Peruvian secret service, the Court of Appeal found that the applicant’s statements were “merely of a general nature”, had not been “specified (geconcretiseerd) in any way” and had “in no way been related to his person”, so that it was unnecessary to order an investigation by a Ministry of Justice liaison officer. Further being of the opinion that the applicant had misused a diplomatic passport in the hope of avoiding luggage checks and that his explanation for the size of the sum of money was not substantiated, the Court of Appeal went on to find him guilty of having intentionally imported cocaine and sentenced him to inter alia five years’ imprisonment. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law to the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad). His counsel submitted two points of appeal. On 3 November 1998 the Supreme Court gave judgment dismissing the applicant’s appeal.",0,673
1308,1308,"The applicant, Ms Ayshat Azretovna Gochayeva, is a Russian national who was born in 1936 and lives in the town of Tyrnyauz in the Kabardino-Balkaruya Republic. She is represented before the Court by Mr I. Kuchukov, a lawyer practising in Nalchik. The respondent Government were represented by Mr P. Laptev, former Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant was the owner of a flat in a block of flats in Elbrusskiy Avenue in the town of Tyrnyauz in the Kabardino-Balkaruya Republic. She lived in the flat with her family. In July 2000 some of the residential quarters of Tyrnyauz were flooded as a result of a powerful mudslide. Many buildings were destroyed or damaged and many people were killed or injured. The mudslide also destroyed a bridge in the vicinity of the applicant’s block of flats. On 28 August 2003 the Tyrnyauz Town Council decided to build a new bridge. The municipal land on which the applicant’s block of flats was situated was allocated for that purpose. The Town Council sued the residents for eviction. On 12 September 2003 the Elbrusskiy District Court of the Kabardino-Balkariya Republic ordered that the applicant’s family be evicted from their flat and that the Tyrnyauz Town Council provide them with other comfortable housing of an equal value. Eviction of other 31 families from the same block of flats or from the neighbouring blocks of flats was ordered by the same judgment. On the same day the court issued a writ of execution. The applicant appealed. On 2 October 2003 the bailiffs’ service opened enforcement proceedings. On 10 October 2003 the bailiffs forcibly evicted the applicant’s family from the flat. No substitute housing was provided. On 11 November 2003 the applicant’s block of flats was demolished. On 3 December 2003 the Supreme Court of the Kabardino-Balkariya Republic quashed the judgment of 12 September 2003. It held that the District Court had unlawfully joined the proceedings concerning 32 families and had ordered their eviction without taking into account particular circumstances of each family, that it had not informed some of the defendants about the date of the hearing, that the defendants had not been offered a choice between monetary compensation and substitute housing. It further held that the District Court should have identified a specific flat for the applicant’s family and that the eviction should have been made conditional on making that flat available or on payment of monetary compensation. The case was remitted before the District Court for a new examination. On 20 May 2004 the applicant lodged a counterclaim for damages. She submitted that the eviction of her family and the demolition of her flat had been unlawful for the following reasons. Firstly, at the time of the eviction the eviction order had not yet been enforceable because an appeal had been pending against the judgment of 12 September 2003. Secondly, no substitute housing had been provided. She argued that she had been unlawfully deprived of her home and property and claimed 420,230 Russian roubles (RUB) in respect of pecuniary damage representing the cost of a flat of an equal value. She also claimed RUB 500,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage against the Elbrusskiy District Court and the bailiffs’ service. On 9 December 2004 the Nalchik Town Court of the Kabardino-Balkariya Republic allowed the applicant’s claims in part. The court found that the expropriation of the applicant’s flat and the eviction of her family had been necessary for the purpose of bridge construction. However, the eviction had been carried out unlawfully as the applicant had not received any prior compensation or been offered substitute housing. It ordered that the construction company that had demolished the applicant’s block of flats pay her RUB 420,230 in respect of pecuniary damage. It further rejected the applicant’s claim in respect of non-pecuniary damage, finding that there had been no evidence of unlawfulness in the acts of the Elbrusskiy District Court and the bailiffs’ service. The fault belonged to the Tyrnyauz Town Council against which no claim for non-pecuniary damage had been lodged. The applicant did not appeal against that judgment and it became final and enforceable ten days later. The construction company lodged an application for supervisory review of the judgment which was examined on 23 June 2005 by the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Kabardino-Balkariya Republic. The Presidium amended the operative part of the judgment of 9 December 2004, ordering that the award in respect of pecuniary damage should be payable by the Tyrnyauz Town Council. The applicant received the award on 14 November 2006. No one shall be deprived of his property except on the basis of a court order. Expropriation of property in the public interest shall be conditional on prior and full compensation (Article 35 § 3 of the Constitution). A judgment of the first-instance court becomes final and enforceable after the expiry of the time-limit for lodging an appeal or after it has been upheld by the appeal court (Articles 209 § 1 and 210 of the Russian Code of Civil Procedure of 14 November 2002). In exceptional cases, where a delay in enforcement can cause considerable damage or impossibility of enforcement, a court may order, at the plaintiff’s request, immediate enforcement of the judgment. Such an order shall be made in the operative part of the judgment or in a separate decision which is amenable to appeal. The decision shall be taken after a hearing and the parties shall be appraised of its date (Articles 204 and 212). A writ of execution is issued by a court after the judgment has become final or an order for immediate enforcement has been made (Article 428).",0,966

As the pensions of public servants and judges are not indexed in Italy, successive adjustments produced a situation in which the amount of pension paid by the State to retired judges having the same grade and with the same number of years of service but having retired at different dates varied considerably, in a way which the applicant considered to be unjustified. 24. Consequently, at the same time as a number of other retired judges, on 11 November 1980, the applicant appealed to the Italian Court of Audit against a decree of the Ministry of Justice rejecting his application for the amount of his pension to be increased; he argued that the provisions of the legislation on which the disparity of treatment was based were unconstitutional. 25. On 18 November 1980 the secretariat of the Court of Audit asked the Ministry of Justice to forward the applicant’s file, which was done on 5 December 1980. 26. On 31 December 1980 the file was sent to the principal public prosecutor attached to the Court of Audit, so that he could investigate the case and formulate his submissions. These submissions were added to the file on 19 January 1982. 27. On 7 June 1982 the principal public prosecutor, considering that the case raised questions of principle, asked for it to be examined by the combined divisions of the Court of Audit. 28. Subsequently, examination of the appeal was adjourned pending the outcome of an appeal to the combined divisions of the Court of Audit entered by the principal public prosecutor on 5 July 1982 against a decision of the division having jurisdiction over pensions, given in an analogous case. 29. These appeal proceedings proved to be lengthy. At the first hearing, arranged to take place on 6 October 1982, a first objection of unconstitutionality was raised. The combined divisions of the Court of Audit held that the objection was not manifestly ill-founded and, in decision (ordinanza) no. 73 of the same date, referred the matter to the Constitutional Court. 30. The Constitutional Court gave its decision in a judgment filed on 7 March 1984. 31. The case was again submitted to the combined divisions of the Court of Audit after a request to that effect had been made by the avvocato dello Stato (counsel representing the State) on 7 January 1985. A hearing was arranged for 5 June 1985. At that hearing a second objection of unconstitutionality was raised. The Court of Audit held that the second objection was not manifestly ill-founded and once again referred the matter to the Constitutional Court in decision no. 104 of the same date. 32. The file was sent to the Constitutional Court on 18 September 1985. The Constitutional Court arranged for the objection of unconstitutionality to be examined at a hearing on 21 April 1988. Its judgment was transmitted to the combined divisions of the Court of Audit on 23 June 1988. 33. The case was due to be heard by the combined divisions of the Court of Audit on 12 October 1988 but had to be adjourned by the court until 27 October 1988, following a strike by its staff. On that date the Court of Audit referred the case to the relevant division. Its decision was filed with the registry on 14 November 1988. 34. The relevant decision arranged for this case and the numerous others pending, including the applicant’s, to be heard on 22 February 1989. 35. In a judgment dated 13 March 1989, filed with the registry on 20 March, it partially upheld the applicant’s appeal and ordered the readjustment of his pension, re- evaluation of the sums due and payment of interest on those sums."" 8. On 17 July 1989 the principal public prosecutor communicated that judgment to the Minister of Justice in order for him to arrange for its execution.",1,681
1312,1312,"The applicants, Mr Ahmet Yavuz, Mr Abdurrahman Işık and Ms Behiye Öner, are Turkish nationals who were born in 1966, 1957 and 1957, respectively, and live in Izmir. They were represented before the Court by Mr S. Çetinkaya, a lawyer practising in Izmir. The Turkish Government did not designate an Agent for the purpose of the proceedings before the Court. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 29 July 2002 the applicants were taken into police custody by policemen from the Anti-Terrorism Department of the Izmir Security Directorate on suspicion of membership of the illegal PKK (the Kurdistan Workers’ Party). Subsequently, their houses were searched and the incident reports were signed by the applicants. During the search, the police found documents relating to the PKK. Magazines published by the PKK were also found in the first applicant’s house. On the same day the applicants signed forms whereby their rights as detainees were explained to them. The forms included their right to inform one of their relatives about their detention and their right to request the assistance of a lawyer. According to the custody records (nezaret kayıt defteri), the police informed Ms Sadiye Yavuz (the wife of the first applicant), Ms Türkan Işık (the wife of the second applicant) and Mr Metin Öner (the brother of the third applicant) about the applicants’ detention. Moreover, it was noted in these records that the applicants did not request the assistance of a lawyer. In their police statements, the applicants accepted the charges against them. The first applicant gave a detailed description of his role in the PKK. On 31 July 2002 the applicants were questioned by the Izmir State Security Court Public Prosecutor. Before the public prosecutor, the applicants denied the charges against them and refuted the statements they had made to the police. The same day the applicants were brought before an investigating judge at the Izmir State Security Court. They confirmed the statements which they had made to the public prosecutor. The court ordered the detention on remand of the first two applicants and released the third applicant. By an indictment dated 5 August 2002, the public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against the applicants in the Izmir State Security Court. The first applicant was accused of membership of the PKK and the last two applicants were accused of aiding and abetting that organisation. The applicants were represented by their lawyers during the domestic proceedings. On 19 December 2002, taking into account the illegal documents found in his house, the witness testimonies that confirmed his involvement in the illegal organisation and recalling the fact that he had been previously convicted of aiding and abetting the PKK in 1997, the Izmir State Security Court found the first applicant guilty of being a member of the PKK. It accordingly sentenced him to twelve years and six months’ imprisonment under Article 168 of the Criminal Code. The court further acquitted the second and third applicants of the charges against them. The first applicant appealed. On 9 June 2003 the Court of Cassation, upholding the State Security Court’s reasoning and assessment of evidence, rejected the applicant’s appeal. The third paragraph of Article 128 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as amended by Law no. 4744 of 6 February 2002, provides that, when a person is arrested, a family member or another person designated by the arrested person shall be promptly informed of the arrest or the prolongation of the custody period by the public prosecutor.",0,588
1318,1318,"The applicant, Mr Zbigniew Prokopyszyn, is a Polish national who was born in 1964 and lives in Głogów. The applicant informed the Court that on 1 February 2005 he had changed his surname to “Prokopyszyn” and he submitted an official document to that effect. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Głogów. On 20 March 2001 the applicant was suspected of having committed aggravated burglary and fraud as a result of which a third person’s property had been disposed of to the detriment of its owner. On 29 May 2001 the applicant was arrested and placed in police custody. On 31 May 2001 the Radomsko District Court ordered that the applicant be detained. The court based its detention order on a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences, the severity of the likely penalty, the risk of the applicant’s “avoiding the administration of justice” and his relapse into crime. Subsequent decisions extending the applicant’s pre-trial detention were taken by the Radomsko Regional Court on 16 August 2001, 25 October 2001, 21 December 2001, an unknown subsequent date, 31 May 2002, 27 June 2002, 13 September 2002 and 28 October 2002 and on an unknown subsequent date. The court referred to the need to conduct further investigations, the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences, the risk of the applicant’s obstructing the proper course of the proceedings (especially, in view of the fact that he had previously gone into hiding). The applicant appealed against the decisions extending his detention on several occasions. All of his appeals were dismissed. On many occasions the applicant requested that his detention pending trial be lifted. On each occasion his requests were dismissed. The decisions to that effect were given by the Piotrków Trybunalski District Court (a decision of 20 June 2001) and the Radomsko Regional Court (decisions of 27 June 2001, 24 October 2001, 21 December 2001, 27 February 2002, 16 April 2002, 9 May 2002, 21 May 2002 and 8 July 2002). These decisions relied on the fact that the reasons for which the applicant had been initially detained were still valid. Neither the applicant’s family situation nor his state of health had been found as such to justify lifting his pre-trial detention. The applicant appealed unsuccessfully against some of the decisions dismissing his requests for release. On 16 October 2001 a bill of indictment was lodged with the Radomsko Regional Court. The applicant was charged with aggravated burglary and fraud as a result of which a third party’s property had been disposed of to the detriment of its owner. Hearings were held on: 23 November 2001, 9 January 2002, 30 January 2002, 20 February 2002, 20 March 2002, 29 March 2002, 16 April 2002, 24 April 2002, 29 April 2002, 14 June 2002, 17 July 2002, 14 August 2002, 6 September 2002, 11 October 2002, 6 November 2002, 11 December 2002, 15 January 2003, 12 February 2003, 7 March 2003 and 12 March 2003. From 11 June 2001 to 7 February 2002 and from 5 July 2002 to 15 October 2004 the applicant was serving prison sentences in respect of his other convictions. Therefore, for one year and four months of the period of his pre-trial detention, which lasted one year and nine months, the applicant was serving his prison sentences. On 12 March 2003 the Radomsko District Court found the applicant guilty of the offences he had been charged with and sentenced him to four and a half years’ imprisonment. The applicant appealed. On 22 August 2003 the Piotrków Trybunalski Regional Court upheld the judgment. As the applicant did not lodge a cassation appeal, the judgment became final. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of detention on remand (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its prolongation, release from detention and rules governing other, so-called “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) are stated in the Court’s judgments in cases of Gołek v. Poland, no. 31330/02, §§ 27-33, 25 April 2006 and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, §§ 22-23, 4 August 2006.",0,708

In a letter of 26 July 2000 to the Religious Affairs Department (“the Department”) the applicant complained that under domestic legislation, anyone attending Koranic study classes had to be at least twelve years old (at the material time that was the normal primary-school leaving age). As his son did not satisfy that requirement, the applicant requested dispensation to enrol him in religious-study classes of that kind. In his letter the applicant also referred to Articles 9 and 14 of the Convention. In a letter of 1 August 2000 the Department replied that section 3 of Law no. 4415 required students enrolling in such classes to have obtained the primary-school leaving certificate and refused the applicant's request. Section 3 of Law no. 4415, supplementing the Religious Affairs Department (Establishment and Functions) Act (Law no. 633), provides: “The Religious Affairs Department shall afford those wishing to learn about the Koran and its interpretation and to increase their knowledge of religion the opportunity to attend Koranic study classes, outside the compulsory religious-education lessons at primary and secondary schools, provided that they have obtained the primary-school leaving certificate. ...”",0,218

Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant is a bailiff. In February 2002 (according to the applicant) or January 2003 (according to the Government) the applicant sued his employer, the Ministry of Justice, for unpaid night shifts and overtime. On 16 October 2003 the Justice of the Peace of Circuit 4 of the Frunzenskiy District of Ivanovo ordered the Ministry to recalculate the applicant’s salary from 2000, to pay arrears, and to amend the applicant’s contract. On 4 December 2003 the Frunzenskiy District Court of Ivanovo upheld this judgment on appeal and the judgment became binding. It was gradually enforced by 22 December 2004. Under section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997, a bailiff must enforce a judgment within two months.",0,202

He is represented before the Court by Mr Boris Kozjak, a lawyer practising in Virovitica, Croatia. The respondent Government are represented by their Agent Ms Lidija Lukina-Karajković. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. During the night of 6 to 7 February 1993 a group of eight accomplices burglarised the applicant’s houses in the Naudovac village in Croatia. On 18 April 1994 the applicant filed a civil action against the perpetrators before the Virovitica Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Virovitici), seeking damages for his destroyed and stolen property. Before the period to be examined by the Court (i.e. before 5 November 1997 when the Convention entered into force in respect of Croatia) the court of first instance held two hearings. The hearing scheduled for 10 February 1998 was adjourned because the defendants did not appear. However, the court heard the applicant. The hearing scheduled for 12 May 1998 was adjourned because a witness did not appear. At the hearing of 25 June 1998 the court heard five defendants. The hearing scheduled for 22 September 1999 was adjourned because three defendants did not appear. At the next hearing on 13 October 1999 the court heard one witness. The case was then transferred to another judge. On 5 October 2000 the court invited the applicant to pay an advance for the costs of an expertise. On 15 February 2001 the applicant paid the advance. On 11 June 2001 the court carried out an on the spot investigation of the damages on the applicant’s house together with an expert. On 21 August 2001 the appointed expert submitted his expertise to the court. On 28 August 2001 the court sent the expertise to the parties. On 31 August and 11 September 2001 the applicant and the defendants, respectively, informed the court that they had no objections to the expertise submitted. On 4 January 2002 the court invited the applicant to adjust his claim with the results of the expertise. The next hearing scheduled for 27 February 2002 was adjourned because a witness did not appear. At the next hearing on 29 March 2002 the applicant specified his claim. On 5 April 2002 the court of first instance pronounced its judgment. On 2 and 3 July 2002 the applicant and five defendants, respectively, appealed against the judgment.

The administrative proceedings On 19 October 1993 the Munich Labour Office (Arbeitsamt) dismissed the applicant’s request of 9 March 1993 for payment of unemployment benefits because he had not fulfilled the statutory condition of having been employed for a minimum of 360 days within the last three years at the time of his request. The Office considered that the applicant had performed functions as manager and thus as employer in Austria. On 18 November 1993 the applicant lodged an administrative appeal (Widerspruch) against the above decision, arguing that he had worked as an employee in Austria, where he had paid social security contributions. On 22 March 1994 the Munich Labour Office dismissed the applicant’s administrative appeal without giving reasons on the substance.",0,166

The Court did not mention any specific amounts, instead suggesting that the debtor calculate them on a certain basis. 8. The above judgment was not appealed and became final.

1340,1340,"9. The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Diyarbakır. He was a student at the Medical Faculty of the Diyarbakır Dicle University at the time of the events described below. 10. On 4 April 1997 the applicant was arrested and placed in custody by police officers from the Diyarbakır Security Directorate. He was accused of membership of an illegal organisation, the YEKBUN (Kurdistan United People’s Party). 11. The police officers interrogated the applicant in relation to his alleged involvement in the YEKBUN. The applicant alleged that he had been subjected to ill-treatment by the officers during the interrogation which caused an oedema, a bruised nose and a broken tooth. According to the Government, the applicant’s injuries occurred when, due to lack of sleep, he inadvertently fell and hit his nose on a sink. 12. On 6 April 1997 the applicant signed a statement according to which he hit his nose on a sink while washing his face. The applicant claims that he was forced to sign the statement. He was then taken to the Diyarbakır State Hospital and examined by Dr. R.C. who noted the following: “An oedema and an ecchymosed lesion as a result of trauma have been identified on the nose. ...” 13. On the same day, the applicant was brought before the Diyarbakır State Security Court. Before the court, he denied being a member of an illegal organisation. He stated that he had been subjected to various forms of illtreatment during his detention in police custody and that the statement which he had signed did not reflect the truth of what had happened to him. The court ordered his release pending trial. 14. On 8 April 1997 the applicant filed a criminal complaint with the chief public prosecutor’s office in Diyarbakır against the police officers who had allegedly ill-treated him. The chief public prosecutor ordered that the applicant be examined by a medical expert from the Forensic Medicine Institute. On the same day, he was examined by a forensic medical expert. The expert’s report stated the following: “... There is an abrasion of 1 x 0,5 cm on the left side of the tip of the nose. Furthermore, there is a minimal fracture on the front of the 8th of the lower teeth. There is no danger to the individual’s life. However, the injuries render him unfit for work for two days.” 15. On 15 April 1997 the Diyarbakır public prosecutor issued a decision of non-jurisdiction in respect of the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment and referred the investigation file to the Diyarbakır District Administrative Council in accordance with the Law on the Prosecution of Civil Servants (Memurin Muhakematı Kanunu). 16. On 13 June 1997 the Diyarbakır State Security Court acquitted the applicant of the charges against him. The court took note in its judgment of the applicant’s statement that he had been interrogated by police officers under duress. 17. On 26 June 1997 the Diyarbakır Administrative Council decided that, due to lack of evidence, the police officers who had allegedly illtreated the applicant should not be prosecuted. 18. On 6 August 1997 the applicant filed an objection with the Supreme Administrative Court against the decision of the Diyarbakır Administrative Council. He also lodged a petition with the Diyarbakır Administrative Council and requested a copy of the investigation file. He received no response to his petition. 19. On 14 May 1999 the Supreme Administrative Court confirmed the Administrative Council’s decision of non-prosecution. 20.

1345,1345,"The applicant, Mr János Szilágyi, is a Hungarian national who was born in 1949 and lives in Szigetvár, Hungary. Because of his disability, he is represented before the Court by his brother, Mr I. Szilágyi. The Government are represented by Mr L. Höltzl, Agent, Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement. The Szigetvár Public Water System Corporation (Szigetvári Víziközmű Társulat) was founded on 14 May 1998. The applicant, co-owner of real estate in Szigetvár, was obliged to become a member, pursuant to section 34 § 4 of the Act on Water Management (“the Act”). According to paragraph 5 of the same section, the applicant had to pay a compulsory membership fee, a so-called “beneficiary’s contribution” (érdekeltségi hozzájárulás), to the Corporation. The amount of the fee (in the applicant’s case, 167,580 Hungarian forints) was determined in relation to the size of his real estate. The decisions concerning the fees payable by each member were dispatched in July 1998. On 3 December 1998 and every year afterwards, a reminder was sent to the applicant about the sum he owed the Corporation. Disputing the latter, the applicant wrote a complaining letter to the Corporation on 12 April 1999. On 20 June 1999 the applicant challenged the constitutionality of the Act before the Constitutional Court. On 29 June 2001 that court dismissed the applicant’s motion, together with several other similar cases. It held that the unilateral action of the legislator, obliging inhabitants of a certain area to be members of a public water system corporation and regulating their rights and obligations concerning the use of water, was justified by the public interest in preserving the quality of water and in protecting the environment. In so far as the applicant’s complaint concerned the conditions of compulsory membership of a specific corporation, the Constitutional Court found that the ordinary courts had jurisdiction in such matters. In this connection it also noted that the corporation was not an administrative body and that the corporation and its members had a relationship under civil, rather than administrative, law. It was observed that any member disputing the fee payable had the right to seek judicial review within 30 days counted from the date of notification of the imposition of the fee (sections 41 § 3 and 43 § 2 of the Act). On 1 March 2002 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Szigetvár District Court against the Corporation. He claimed that his membership of the corporation was not only involuntary but also unlawful, in that the water supply for his real estate was not provided by the corporation. In the absence of any service performed by the corporation, no liabilities should have arisen on his part. On 17 April 2002 the applicant completed his action. In the first paragraph on page 7 of his submission he wrote: “...The purposeless dispute has been going on between the parties since July 1998, for almost four years. The water management company obliges János Szilágyi to make beneficiary’s contributions at the price of infringing his rights!” On 4 July 2002 the District Court rejected the applicant’s action without an examination of its merits. It held that it had been submitted outside the 30-day statutory time-limit following the delivery of the impugned decision, laid down in section 43 § 2 of the Act on Water Management. It reasoned that: “the applicant himself stated in his submissions clarifying his action (in the first paragraph on page 7) that a decision obliging him to pay a contribution was delivered to him in July 1998”. In his appeal the applicant requested the annulment of the first instance order and contested the District Court’s statements. He argued that the District Court had, by stating that he had admitted that a decision had been served on him in July 1998, misquoted the first paragraph of page 7 of his submissions. In fact, no formal decision had been given, or served on him, in July 1998 or on any other subsequent date. The applicant argued that, no decision having ever been given, he could not possibly have missed any time-limit. On 25 November 2002 the Baranya County Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It found that: “the applicant had not attached the disputed decision to his submissions, but he had received it; this fact was rightly referred to by the District Court, which the second-instance court quotes, for the sake of emphasis: « The water management company obliges János Szilágyi to make beneficiary’s contributions ».”",0,743

On 18 January 2002 the applicants requested the Cracow Municipal Office to pay compensation for part of their predecessor's plots of land which had been expropriated as a part of the land development plans, namely for the construction of a road. 8. On 9 August 2002 the Cracow Municipal Office requested the Małopolski Governor to issue a formal confirmation that the expropriation had taken place. 9. On 25 September 2002 the applicants submitted a copy of the Cracow District Court's decision declaring them successors as to 1/6 of the property of their predecessor in title. 10.

The Governor also summoned them to submit certain documents. 11. On 12 May 2003 the applicants lodged a complaint with the President of the Office for Housing and Town Development about inactivity on the part of the Małopolski Governor. On 30 June 2003 the President of the Office for Housing and Town Development dismissed their complaint finding that the delay in the proceedings was caused by difficulties in finding other successors. 12. On 3 October 2003 the Cracow Municipal Office informed the applicants that the proceedings would lie dormant until the delivery of a decision by the Małopolski Governor. 13. On 17 November 2003 the applicants requested the Cracow Municipal Office to take action with a view of establishing the whereabouts of other parties to the proceedings. 14.

On 21 May 2004 the Cracow Municipal Office informed the Governor of the addresses of two successors in title, W.P. and E.S-S. 18. In October 2004 the Governor requested the Cracow District Court to appoint a guardian for persons whose whereabouts remained unknown. 19. On 13 January 2005 the Cracow District Court stayed the proceedings since the Governor's representative had failed to comply with the court's order to submit certain information concerning the case. The proceedings were resumed on a later unknown date. 20. On 21 March 2005 the applicants lodged a complaint with the Cracow Regional Administrative Court about inactivity on the part of the Małopolski Governor. On 29 March 2006 the Cracow Regional Administrative Court allowed the applicants' complaint, held that the proceedings had not been conducted with necessary diligence and obliged the Governor to issue a decision on the merits. 21. On 11 July 2006 the Małopolski Governor informed the applicants about further delays in the proceedings. 22. On 25 October 2006 the Małopolski Governor appointed an expert to prepare an estimate of the value of plots. 23. On 12 December 2006 the Małopolski Governor gave a decision confirming that on 1 January 1999 the Cracow Municipality had acquired ownership of the property concerned which had been expropriated for the purposes of implementing the land development plans. 24. On 2 and 3 July 2007 the Cracow Mayor gave two decisions granting compensation to the applicants.",1,593
1349,1349,"8. The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Plovdiv. He used to work as a shunter at the Bulgarian State Railways. On 15 August 1995 he was dismissed from his work for having breached disciplinary regulations. 9. On 5 February 1996 the applicant filed with the Plovdiv District Court an action for wrongful dismissal against his former employer. 10. On 12 March 1996 the District Court heard the applicant and his lawyer and rejected the case, ruling that the applicant’s dismissal was not amenable to judicial review. It based its decision on section 9(3) of the Decree No. 9 of 6 January 1981 and the Supreme Court’s practice, according to which employees of the State Railways dismissed for breach of disciplinary regulations could only appeal to a higher administrative body, not to a court. 11. On 18 March 1996 the applicant appealed to the Plovdiv Regional Court against the District Court’s decision. He argued that Decree No. 9 was contrary to Article 6 of the Convention. He also relied on an amendment to the Labour Code of 1993, stating that it vested with the courts power to examine all appeals for wrongful dismissal, despite the provisions of Decree No. 9. 12. By decision bearing the date 8 April 1996 the Regional Court, sitting in private, dismissed the applicant’s appeal, holding that in accordance with Decree No. 9 a judicial appeal against the applicant’s dismissal was not possible. 13. The Regional Court’s decision was not pronounced publicly and was not served. 14. On 4 June 1996 the case file was transmitted by the judge-rapporteur to the Regional Court’s clerical staff which made an entry in the court’s register. 15. On 5 June 1996 the case file was transmitted to the District Court and an entry was made in its register. 16. On 13 June 1996 the applicant submitted a petition for review (преглед по реда на надзора) to the Supreme Administrative Court. 17. The parties were summoned for a hearing but none of them appeared. 18. On 18 July 1997, sitting in private, the Supreme Administrative Court rejected the petition for review as time barred. It held that the Regional Court’s decision had entered into force on 8 April 1996 and that the two months’ time-limit for submission of a petition for review had expired on 8 June 1996 whereas the petition had been submitted on 13 June 1996. 19. At the relevant time, in accordance with Decree No. 9 of 6 January 1981, employees of the State Railways were subject to a special legal regime. They had ranks, wore uniforms and were subject to strict hierarchy and discipline, under the control of the Ministry of Transport. Decree No. 9 set out the special rules governing service in the State Railways. The Labour Code had subsidiary application. 20. Section 9 of the Decree, as in force at the relevant time and until February 1997, provided, inter alia, that disputes about wrongful dismissal of employees of the State Railways were amenable to review by the higher administrative authority only. As a result, until August 1996 the courts’ practice was to reject actions for wrongful dismissal of railways’ employees. 21. In a judgment of 19 August 1996 the Supreme Administrative Court, departing from earlier practice, held that the prohibition of judicial review under Decree No. 9 was to be considered abandoned since 1 March 1993, the date on which an amendment to the Labour Code had entered into force (опр. no. 641 от 19.8.1996 г., Бюлетин на ВС, кн. 10-1996 г., стр. 17). 22. The relevant part of section 9 of Decree No. 9 was eventually repealed by the Constitutional Court by decision of 18 February 1997 as unconstitutional and contrary to Article 6 of the Convention. The Constitutional Court held that dismissal from work could not be excluded from the jurisdiction of the courts, regard being had to the fact that the right to work is one of the fundamental constitutional rights (реш. no. 5 от 18.2.1997 по конст. дело no. 25/96 г. на КС на РБ, Държавен вестник, бр. 20/97). 23. In November 2000 the remainder of Decree No. 9 was repealed and the special legal regime of State Railways employees abandoned. 24. Under the Code of Civil Procedure as in force at the relevant time, service was required only in respect of judgments and certain types of procedural decisions issued by a first level of jurisdiction. 25. Judgments or decisions delivered by a court acting as a second level jurisdiction were not served despite the fact that most of them were amenable to review (преглед по реда на надзора), within particular time limits, before the Supreme Court (which was later reconstituted into the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court of Cassation). 26. As a result, whenever second instance cases were decided in private (which was the rule in appeals against procedural decisions), the parties could only learn whether or not their case had been decided by visiting the respective court and checking its register periodically. 27. Article 226 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as in force at the relevant time, provided that a petition for review could be submitted within two months from the impugned decision’s entry into force. At that time judgments and decisions issued by a second level of jurisdiction entered into force on the date on which they were made (opr. 3022-95-III). 28. According to the applicant, the courts nevertheless would normally count the two-month time-limit from the date on which the second instance judgment or decision was entered in the respective register. No relevant case-law has been cited by the parties.",1,939
1354,1354,"The applicant, Mr William Durham, is a British national who was born in 1934 and lives in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr D. Walton of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 13 August 2003, the applicant, owner of a van, received a notice from the police stating that his vehicle had been photographed speeding at 50 miles per hour in a restricted zone on 10 August 2003. He was asked to name the driver. A final reminder was sent to him on 19 September 2003 allowing him a further fourteen days to provide the required information, failing which he would be prosecuted for the additional offence of failing to give the name and address of the driver, contrary to section 172 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. He replied stating that he did not know who the driver was and that he did not believe it was his van in the photograph. On 17 January 2004, the applicant received two summonses to appear before the Magistrates’ Court, one stating that he was the driver of the van and the second that he had failed to give information as to the driver of the vehicle. On 24 March 2004, the Magistrates’ Court acquitted the applicant of being the driver of the vehicle alleged to have been exceeding the speed limit. It convicted him of failure to give information about the driver. He was fined GBP 220, with his licence to be endorsed with three penalty points. The relevant domestic law and practice is set out in O’Halloran and Francis v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 15809/02 and 25624/02, §§ 2531, ECHR 2007...",0,295
1358,1358,"The applicants is a Finnish national born in 1915. He resides in Lieto. He is represented before the Court by Mr Kai Kaituri, a lawyer in Paattinen. In 1991 the applicant signed certain employment contracts on behalf of a group of companies. In decisions of 14 October 1992 the relevant pension insurance company found that as the applicant’s companies had not been registered as legal persons the applicant himself had to be regarded as the employer. As a result the applicant was obliged to pay over FIM 114,000 (approximately the same in FF) in employer’s contributions. According to the attached notice of appeal, an appeal was to be signed by the appellant himself or any other author. If the appeal was not signed by the appellant, it should include a power-of-attorney and indicate the representative’s profession and address. The applicant contested the decisions of the pension insurance company in appeals to the Pension Board (eläkelautakunta, pensionsnämnden). The appeals were signed by the applicant himself but indicated Mr Kaituri as their author. The addresses of both were stated. In decisions of 17 October 1994 the Pension Board refused the applicant’s appeals. The decisions were dispatched to the applicant’s address by regular mail on 26 October 1994. The applicant allegedly received the decisions on 5 December 1994 and on 16 December 1994 he appealed to the Insurance Court (vakuutusoikeus, försäkringsdomstolen). On 21 December 1995 the Insurance Court declined to examine the merits of the applicant’s appeals, considering that they had been lodged out of time. The Insurance Court noted that the appeals to the Pension Board had been signed by the applicant himself and that he had been “assisted” by Mr Kaituri. In his appeal to the Insurance Court the applicant had explained that the letters from the Pension Board had arrived in a post box which he did not empty every day, inter alia due to his disability. Having been invited to explain this point further, the applicant had stated to the Insurance Court that in November 1994 he had not been expecting any mail which would have required action. As for the Pension Board’s forthcoming decisions, he had expected to be notified thereof through his “representative” Mr Kaituri. The Insurance Court found that the applicant had not submitted sufficient evidence, inter alia of his allegation that he had received the Pension Board’s decisions only on 5 December 1994. The Insurance Court concluded therefore that the applicant should be deemed to have received them on 2 November 1994, in accordance with the presumption stated in the relevant notice of appeal. Consequently, the applicant’s further appeals should have been lodged at the latest on 2 December 1994. The applicant applied to the Supreme Court for restoration of the time-limit for appealing against the Pension Board’s decisions. He further sought to have the Insurance Court’s decision nullified (poistaa, undanröja) and applied for cost-free proceedings with Mr Kaituri as his representative. Mr Kaituri was indicated as the drafter of the application to have the time-limit restored. On 23 May 1996 the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen) refused the applicant’s request for cost-free proceedings, noting that under law a grant to this effect was not possible in matters before the Insurance Court. The Supreme Court found no grounds for nullifying the Insurance Court’s decision or reinstating the proceedings.",0,554

On 22 January 1998 the applicants filed a civil action before the District Court of Nicosia against the Bank of Cyprus Ltd concerning a deposit they had allegedly made to the latter in 1993. The applicants stated that, before filing the action, they had complained to the police and to the Attorney-General of the Republic, who they maintained, refused to investigate their case. 6. The pleadings were completed on 16 November 1998 following five adjournments at the defendant’s request, with the applicants’ consent, in relation to the filing of its defence. 7. From 16 November 1998 until 24 February 2003 the case was adjourned four times at the defendant’s request and with the applicants’ consent, twice at the parties’ and once at the applicant’s request. Further, the court adjourned the case six times mainly for the purpose of dealing with other civil actions. For example the case was adjourned from 30 April 1999 until 7 October 1999 and then to 1 February 2000; from November 2000 to 26 March 2001 and from 24 September 2001 until 28 February 2002 for directions. Within this period, the court also dealt with an interlocutory application filed by the defendant in the proceedings. 8. The hearing of the case commenced on 24 February 2003 and concluded on 22 April 2003. Within this period a total of four hearing sessions were held and an interim decision was delivered. 9. On 23 May 2003 the district court delivered its judgment dismissing the applicants’ action with costs to be paid by them. 10. Article 30 (2) of the Cypriot Constitution in so far as relevant provides as follows: (2) “In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., every person is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... court ...”. 11. On 30 July 2001 the Supreme Court adopted “The Rule of Judicial Practice” which provides as follows: “During the Court’s meeting of 3 July 2001 and before the Court proceeds with its judicial work, the President announced the issuing of the following Judicial Rule of practice”. The President of the Supreme Court Mr G.M. Pikis stated as follows: “With the unanimous agreement of all the Judges of the Supreme Court, the following Rule of Practice is issued: It is acknowledged that the duty for the hearing of cases within reasonable time is the individual duty of the trial judge and a collective duty of the judicial function. The establishment of rules for conducting a trial within reasonable time and the supervision of the procedures towards preventing delays is the responsibility of the Supreme Court. Its performance must be regulated in a way which secures, not only in advance but also during the course of the trial of cases, that the safeguards set by Article 30.2 of the Constitution and the principles governing the proper administration of Justice, as set out in circulars of the Supreme Court, are complied with. For achieving this purpose, the present Rule of Practice is adopted. Whenever it comes within the knowledge of the Supreme Court (either through the Registries or following representations made by any person having an interest in the trial of the case without delay) that the trial of the case is being delayed, or it appears from the arrangements made – in respect of its trial– that it is possible that the trial be delayed, or where it appears that the hearing is not conducted uninterruptedly as determined by the circulars of the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court may issue directions for preventing delays in the hearing of the case and for the uninterrupted trial of the case as it deems fit. The responsibility of observing the conduct of cases undergoing trial, for the purpose of briefing the Supreme Court of delays noted or envisaged in the trial of civil and criminal cases, shall be vested with the Registrar, who will serve at the Supreme Court. The gathering of information on this matter shall be regulated by the Chief Registrar in due course”.",1,686

The Slovak Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs M. Pirošíková. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 13 December 2004 the applicant’s wife initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant for bodily harm. On 14 December 2004 the applicant’s wife left for Karlovy Vary in the Czech Republic. Without the applicant’s knowledge, she took with her their son. On 20 December 2004 the Karlovy Vary District Court issued an interim measure awarding the applicant’s wife custody of the child. On 26 July 2005 the Považská Bystrica District Police Office discontinued the criminal proceedings on the ground that no crime had been committed. On 26 August 2005 the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings was confirmed by the Považská Bystrica District Prosecutor Office. On 10 February 2005 the applicant lodged an action with the Považská Bystrica District Court petitioning for divorce and seeking determination of the rights and obligations in respect of their child. On 23 March 2005 the applicant sought an interim measure regulating child contact arrangements. On 11 April 2005 the applicant withdrew his submission. On 17 May 2005 the first hearing took place. The District Court adjourned the hearing pending its receipt of the criminal file, the Karlovy Vary District Court’s file as well as the administrative file from the Karlovy Vary Social Affairs Office. On 2 September 2005 the applicant sought an interim measure regulating child contact arrangements. On 8 September 2005 the District Court issued an interim measure. On 20 September 2005 the applicant appealed. On 9 November 2005 the Trenčín Regional Court decided on the appeal. On 1 February 2006 the applicant requested an expert opinion.

1366,1366,"The applicant, Mr Nikolay Milanov Nikolov, is a Bulgarian national who was born in 1963 and lives in Shumen. He is represented before the Court by Ms N. Milanova, a lawyer practising in Shumen. The respondent Government are represented by their Agent, Ms R. Nikolova, of the Ministry of Justice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 7 April 2003 the applicant was attacked in his home in the village of Chernogor by two individuals who beat him with a baseball bat, took his money and ran away. He lost consciousness and suffered four fractured ribs and injuries to his chest and lungs. The police were immediately called to the scene but failed to apprehend the attackers. A preliminary investigation was then opened and, on an unspecified date, two suspects were arrested. On 14 April 2003 the applicant filed a request with the investigating authorities under Article 60 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1974 to join the criminal proceedings as a civil claimant and made a claim for compensation from the assailants in the amount of 50,000 Bulgarian levs (25,565 euros). On 16 May 2003 the assailants were charged with burglary and theft. On 20 June 2003 the prosecuting authorities and the assailants concluded a plea-bargain agreement which was approved by the Tutrakan District Court on 25 June 2003. Under the terms of the agreement, the assailants pled guilty to burglary and theft and were sentenced to three years' imprisonment, suspended for five years. The court did not examine the applicant's civil claim and failed to indicate whether any of the damage caused by the offence had been compensated in any way. At the relevant time, the victim of any tort which was also a publicly prosecutable offence could choose either to initiate a civil action against the alleged tortfeasor, which would then be stayed awaiting the outcome of the pending criminal proceedings (Article 182 § 1 (d) of the Code of Civil Procedure of 1952), or to file a civil claim for damages in the context of the criminal proceedings instituted by the prosecuting authorities (Articles 6064 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1974). In the latter case, the civil claim was examined together with the offender's culpability but could not be a reason for delaying the criminal case as such (Article 64 §§ 1 and 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1974). If the criminal proceedings were terminated, the civil claim was not to be examined but could be submitted to the civil courts (Article 64 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1974). Prior to 3 June 2003 a civil claim could be filed in the context of the criminal proceedings at any time after the criminal proceedings had been opened. Subsequently, it could only be filed once the case had been brought to trial. However, civil claims that had been filed before the amendment entered into force were to be examined under the old procedure (paragraph 142 of the transitory provisions to the Act amending the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1974). In a decision of 16 December 2004 (реш. № 7 от 16 декември 2004 г. по конституционно дело № 6 от 2004 г., обн., ДВ, бр. 112/2004 г.) the Constitutional Court held that the amendment of 3 June 2003 struck a fair balance between victims' rights and the public interest in more efficient, faster, and yet fair criminal proceedings. It noted that the joining of civil claims to criminal proceedings was an optional procedure aimed at assisting victims but that criminal courts were not obliged to admit such claims for examination if this could delay the criminal proceedings. It further emphasised that victims were entitled to bring an action before civil courts at any time. At the relevant time, a plea-bargain agreement could be concluded after the preliminary investigation had been finished (Article 414g § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1974). If pecuniary damage had been caused by the offence, an agreement could be concluded only after the damage had been compensated or adequate security had been provided to the victim (Article 414g § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1974). A plea-bargain agreement was subject to approval by the domestic court, which would then conclude the criminal proceeding with a decision. The decision had the force of a final judgment and was not subject to appeal (Article 414i § 1 and Article 414h § 10 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1974).",0,761
1369,1369,"The applicant, Mr Viktor Mykolayovych Ketko, is a Ukrainian national who was born in 1942 and lives in Kyiv. He is represented before the Court by Ms M. Kudelya, a lawyer practising in Kyiv. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) are represented by their Agent, Mr. Y. Zaytsev. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant owns a 50 % share in AB Imeks Ltd, a joint venture (hereinafter the “Company”). The Company was incorporated on 17 September 1992 as a joint venture with a 49 % share at all relevant times being owned by a Polish partner. The Company and its subsidiary were conducting a gas trading business. The Company also fell into the category of “companies with foreign investments”, within the meaning of the Foreign Investments Act 1992 (the “1992 Act”), until its repeal in 2000. The 1992 Act was adopted with a view to encouraging foreign investments and was applied to companies where a foreign partner had at least a 20% share. This Act established preferential treatment for such companies, including, inter alia, 10 years' immunity from changes in the law governing foreign investments (Section 9). This immunity was to be granted on the making of the relevant application and calculated from the date of its establishment. On 17 February 2000 Parliament passed the Companies set up with National Property and Assets (Termination of Discrimination) Act 2000 (the “2000 Act”), which provided that companies with a foreign shareholding were subject to general tax, customs and currency regulations, and repealed the 1992 Act. The 2000 Act affected all joint ventures irrespective of when the foreign investment had been made. In its judgment of 29 January 2002, the Constitutional Court gave a binding interpretation of Section 5 of the 2000 Act, holding that it provided valid grounds for refusing new and withdrawing previously granted taxation privileges. In November 1998 the Company instituted proceedings in the Lutsk City Court claiming immunity under Section 9 of the 1992 Act. On 18 January 1999 the court found for the Company and declared that, until 17 September 2002, the Company was exempted from any new taxes, duties, changes in the method of calculation or payment of taxes introduced after 17 September 1992. On 4 March 1999 the Volyn Regional Court, following the appeal of the customs authorities, quashed this decision and remitted the case. On 15 June 1999 the Company's claim was declared inadmissible. On 3 November 1999 the Supreme Court, upon the supervisory complaint of its Deputy President, quashed the decisions of 4 March 1999 and 15 June 1999, and upheld the judgment of 18 January 1999, thus reinstating the Company's immunity from any changes in tax and customs law. On 1 December 2000 the Lutsk City Court clarified its judgment of 18 January 1999 upon the Company's request. The court specified that the Company, as well as its subsidiaries, was immune from any changes in fiscal legislation, including that introduced by the 2000 Act. This ruling was upheld by the Volyn Regional Court on 25 June 2001 and by the Supreme Court on 12 October 2001. On 28 October 2002 the Supreme Court rejected the request of the Head of Volyn Customs Office to reopen the proceedings due to the new circumstances. On 17 June 2002 the Central Energy Customs Service (hereafter “CECS”) refused to allow the Company's subsidiary free transit of a certain amount of gas across the Ukrainian border. The Company's subsidiary together with the applicant and the Company's foreign shareholder challenged this decision before the courts. On 25 July 2002 the Podilsky District Court of Kyiv allowed this claim and ordered CECS to allow the gas to be imported, referring in this respect to the January 1999 judgment. On 7 February 2003 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal granted CECS's appeal, quashed the judgment of 25 July 2002 and rejected the claim as unfounded. The court indicated that the 2000 Act, as interpreted by the Constitutional Court, gave sufficient grounds for annulling the taxation privileges enjoyed by the Company and its subsidiary. On 6 May 2003 the Supreme Court rejected the cassation appeal against the judgment of the Kyiv City Court of Appeal as unfounded. Section 2 of that Act provided that it was applicable to companies of any type or form as long as a foreign investor owned at least a 20% share in such a company. According to Section 9 of that Act a “company with foreign investments” falling into the scope of this Act could be granted, upon submission of the relevant application, immunity for a period of ten years from changes in special legislation to do with the regulation of foreign investments. The Preamble specified that the Act's aim was to put companies with foreign shares in an equal position to those without foreign investments, thus protecting free competition and domestic industry. Section 1 of the Act declared that companies with foreign investments were subject to general tax, customs and currency regulations. Section 4 of the Act repealed the 1992 Act. According to Section 5, this Act applied to all joint ventures irrespective of when the foreign investment was made. Following a request from the Cabinet of Ministers, the Constitutional Court gave an official interpretation of Article 5 of the 2000 Act. The court explained that this provision constituted adequate grounds for refusing new and withdrawing previously granted applications for those privileges regarding taxes, customs duties and currency controls.",0,913
1370,1370,"The applicants are Finnish nationals, born in 1945 and 1946 respectively and living in Turku and Kaarina. A. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows. The applicants are Justices at the Court of Appeal of Turku. Between the applicants and the representative of their employer a disagreement arose about the amount of their salary. According to the applicants, they were entitled to receive salary corresponding to a higher salary grade than that actually applied. The Chief Secretary of the Court of Appeal (hovioikeuden kansliapäällikkö, hovrättens kanslichef) made a decision that the applicants were not entitled to the higher salary grade. The applicants asked for a notice of appeal, but did not receive one. The applicants nonetheless appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (korkein hallinto-oikeus, högsta förvaltningsdomstolen), which on 14 November 1996 stated that as the question concerned the interpretation of a collective bargaining contract on civil servants’ salaries, the court was not competent to try the case. The applicants then took legal action against the State in the Labour Court (työtuomioistuin, arbetsdomstolen). On 3 March 1997, the court found that, according to the Act on the Labour Court (laki työtuomioistuimesta, lag om arbetsdomstolen), a civil servant bound by a collective bargaining contract on civil servants’ salaries was allowed to take legal action before the Labour Court. However, since the applicants were not members of a trade union and therefore not bound by the contract, they could not take legal action before the Labour Court. B. Relevant domestic law and practice According to Section 10a, Subsection 2, of the Constitution Act (Suomen Hallitusmuoto, Regeringsform för Finland), as in force at the relevant time, everyone has the freedom of association. Freedom of association entails the right to form an association without a permit, to be a member or not to be a member of an association and to participate in the activities of an association. The freedom to form trade unions and to organise in order to look after other interests is likewise guaranteed. According to Section 5, Subsections 1 and 2, everyone is equal before the law. No one shall, without an acceptable reason, be treated differently from other persons on the ground of sex, age, origin, language, religion, conviction, opinion, health, disability or other reason that concerns his or her person. Section 16 guarantees to everyone the right to have his or her case dealt with appropriately and without undue delay by a legally competent court of law or other authority, as well as to have a decision pertaining to his or her rights or obligations reviewed by a court of law or other independent organ for the administration of justice. In its decision no. 4398 rendered on 31 December 1999 the Supreme Administrative Court held that the above mentioned Section 16, inter alia, guarantees also to a judge not belonging to a trade union the right to have a dispute concerning his salary decided by a court. As the appellants in the case in question could not have their case decided by the Labour Court, the Supreme Administrative Court examined their claim but rejected it on the merits. As from 1 March 2000 the Constitution Act is replaced by the Constitution of Finland (Suomen perustuslaki, Finlands grundlag), which contains provisions identical to those mentioned above.",0,554
1372,1372,"The applicant, Ms Olga Ivanovna Sherstyuk, is a Ukrainian national who was born in 1965 and lives in the town of Popasnaya of the Lugansk region. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev, of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In October 1988 the applicant opened a fixed-term deposit account in the USSR Savings Bank. Under the contract, the annual interest rate on the deposit was 3 %. By a decision of 20 March 1991, the Verkhovna Rada (Parliament) of Ukraine declared the Ukrainian branches of the USSR Savings Bank being a property of the Ukrainian State. The operation of banks and banking activities was regulated by law (see Relevant domestic law, below). Since 1992, Ukrainian economy experienced hyperinflation, with its peak in 1993. On 30 June 1993 the regional branch of the Ukraine Savings Bank (hereinafter – “the Bank”) placed an announcement in the Lugansk Regional Council’s newspaper called “Nasha gazeta”. The announcement read as follows: “The Savings Bank informs As of 1 July this year the annual interest rate on fixed-term deposits and on special deposits for children is set at 220 per cent. No new formalities are required for previously opened fixed-term deposits and special deposits for children.” According to the applicant, having read this announcement and having received confirmation in the local office of the Bank, the applicant decided, contrary to her initial intentions, not to withdraw her money deposited with the Bank. In 1996 the Ukrainian authorities implemented a monetary reform intended to replace the former monetary unit, the karbovanets coupon, with a new currency, the Ukrainian hryvnia (українськa гривнa, UAH), at an exchange rate of 100,000 karbovanets coupons for 1 hryvnia. According to the applicant, in June 2001, having difficulties in understanding the information written in her account statement records, she consulted an expert who, after having examined the above records, found out that since 1994 the annual interest rate on her deposit had been lower than 220%. According to the applicant the annual interest rate on her deposit was 194.7% in 1994, 86.8% in 1995, 29.9% in 1996, 13.7% in 1997, 6.9% in 1998, 7.3% in 1999, and 6.3% in 2000. In July 2001 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Popasna District Court of the Lugansk Region against the Bank seeking compensation for damages caused by decreasing the annual interest rates on her deposit without informing her and without seeking her prior consent. She complained that the Bank fell short of its obligations to pay on her deposit the interests of 220% per year fixed in 1993 after publication of the announcement in the official newspaper of the regional council. According to the applicant, during the hearing, the representative of the Bank, explained, among other things, that in accordance with the Bank’s Statute and instructions of 3 October 1980 and 8 July 1998, the Bank was not obliged to disseminate information about the applicable interest rates, but such information had always been available in branches of the Bank and the applicant could have consulted it there. By its judgment of 25 December 2001, the court rejected the applicant’s claim as unsubstantiated, for the following reasons: “...the defendant, having changed unilaterally the interest rates on the fixed-term deposit had acted in accordance with Article 41 of the Law of Ukraine “on Banks and Banking Activities” in the wording of 1991, under which the Savings Bank of Ukraine sets the interest rates on deposits within the maximum interest rates set by the National Bank of Ukraine. At the same time, this Law does not foresee any other conditions for setting interest rates on deposits, including agreement of depositors. Taking into account, that Laws ... have the highest legal force and are obligatory for implementation by all legal persons and citizens of Ukraine, the court considers that the defendant’s actions on unilateral changes of the interest rates on the fixed-term deposit of the applicant had been lawful, therefore the claims ... are unsubstantiated...” The applicant appealed against this judgment to the Lugansk Regional Court of Appeal. On 4 April 2002 the Lugansk Regional Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the first instance court. In its decision the appellate court, having repeated the reasoning of the first-instance court, also noted that the applicant had deposited her money in 1988 with the interest rate of 3 per cent. Since 1 July 1993 the Bank had been changing the interest rate but the latter never went lower than the original rate of 3 per cent. The applicant appealed in cassation. On 23 June 2003 the panel of three judges of the Supreme Court of Ukraine rejected the applicant’s request for leave to appeal in cassation. Article 41 “Everyone has the right to own, use and dispose of his or her property, and the results of his or her intellectual and creative activity... No one shall be unlawfully deprived of the right of property. The right of private property is inviolable...” Article 41. Interest rates of the Ukraine Savings Bank “The Ukraine Savings Bank fixes the interest rates on the deposits of the population within the limits of the maximum interest rates, established by the National Bank.”",0,879
1373,1373,"The applicant, Mr Zbigniew Kaczmarek, is a Polish national who was born in 1940 and lives in Łódź, Poland. He is represented before the Court by Mr S. Janiszewski, a lawyer practising in Zgierz, Poland. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 28 September 1989 the applicant lodged a claim for the division of matrimonial property with the Łódź District Court (Sąd Rejonowy). The proceedings are pending before the first-instance court. On 17 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”) entered into force. It lays down various legal means designed to counteract and/or redress the undue length of judicial proceedings. Section 2 of the 2004 Act reads, in so far as relevant: Section 5 reads, in so far as relevant: “1. A complaint about the unreasonable length of proceedings shall be lodged while the proceedings are pending. ...” Section 12 provides for measures that may be applied by the court dealing with the complaint. It reads, in so far as relevant: “1. The court shall dismiss a complaint which is unjustified. 2. If the court considers that the complaint is justified, it shall find that there was an unreasonable delay in the impugned proceedings. 3. At the request of the complainant, the court may instruct the court examining the merits of the case to take certain measures within a fixed time-limit. Such instructions shall not concern the factual and legal assessment of the case. 4. If the complaint is justified the court may, at the request of the complainant, grant ... just satisfaction in an amount not exceeding PLN 10,000 to be paid by the State Treasury. If such just satisfaction is granted it shall be paid out of the budget of the court which conducted the delayed proceedings.” Section 18 lays down transitional rules in relation to the applications already pending before the Court. It reads, in so far as relevant: “1. Within six months after the date of entry into force of this law persons who, before that date, had lodged a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights ... complaining of a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time guaranteed by Article 6 (1) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ..., may lodge a complaint about the unreasonable length of the proceedings on the basis of the provisions of this law if their complaint to the Court had been lodged in the course of the impugned proceedings and if the Court has not adopted a decision concerning the admissibility of their case. ...” On 18 January 2005 Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) adopted a resolution (no. III SPP 113/04) in which it ruled that while the 2004 Act produced legal effects as from the date of its date of entry into force (17 September 2004), its provisions applied retroactively to all proceedings in which delays had occurred before that date and had not yet been remedied.",0,533
1376,1376,"The applicant, Mr Helmut Lenz, is a German national, born in 1928 and living in Berlin. He was represented before the Court by Mr K.H. Christoph, of the Berlin Bar. The facts of the case, as presented by the parties, can be summarised as follows. Between 1 September 1967 and 31 August 1990 the applicant worked as a radio journalist in the German Democratic Republic (GDR). He ran the international press-review office until shortly before the entry into force of the German Unification Treaty on 3 October 1990 . On 31 July 1990 the applicant entered into an agreement proposed by his employer under which his contract of employment was to terminate and he would receive an early-retirement pension (Vereinbarung zur Beendigung des Arbeitsrechtsverhältnisses und zur Gewährung von Vorruhestandsgeld) of 1,074 East-German marks a month, in accordance with Article 3a of the Early-Retirement Pensions Order of 8 February 1990 (Verordnung zur Gewährung von Vorruhestandsgeld). The Order required employers to pay qualifying employees an early-retirement pension equal to 70% of their average net wage over the preceding twelve months. Article 9 § 2 of the second implementing provision (Zweite Durchführungsbestimmung) of the Order provided for the pensions to be indexed to changes in pay levels within the firm that would have affected the employee had he or she continued to work. In a judgment of 3 March 1994 the Berlin Regional Court (Landes-arbeitsgericht) dismissed an appeal by the applicant for the same reasons. In a judgment of 27 June 1995, the Federal Labour Court (Bundes-arbeitsgericht) dismissed a further appeal by the applicant, holding that his rights had been extinguished by the entry into force of the Unification Treaty on 3 October 1990. The Federal Court pointed out, firstly, that the obligations of the GDR radio and television company, which was dissolved on reunification, had been assumed by the five Länder situated within the territory of the GDR at the time and the Land of Berlin. It added that by virtue of Article 9 § 2 of the second implementing provision of the Early-Retirement Pensions Order, taken together with Appendix IIa of the German Unification Treaty, the Federal Labour Ministry was in law the successor (Rechtsnachfolger) to the applicant’s former employer. The Federal Court found, further, that the applicant no longer had any right to payment of the difference, as the legal basis for the progressive indexation of the early-retirement pension had disappeared on 3 October 1990, the German Unification Treaty having changed the method by which the level of the early-retirement pension was adjusted. That change had been made with the consent of the parliament of the GDR. Former Article 9 § 2 of the second implementing provision had been repealed and replaced by the “adjustment factor” provisions set out in Article 112a. The Federal Court found, lastly, that the agreement made on 31 July 1990 did not contain any provision giving the applicant any additional rights to those set out in the Early-Retirement Pensions Order of 8 February 1990. In particular, it did not provide for a progressive, long-term revaluation of the applicant’s early-retirement pension in line with changes in wage levels paid by the employer, but expressly stipulated that the pension was granted on the basis of the Order of 8 February 1990. On 14 July 1997 the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungs-gericht), sitting as a bench of three judges, declined to accept a further appeal by the applicant for adjudication. Appendix II, Chapter VIII, section E, paragraph III no. 5 of the German Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990 provides that the Early-Retirement Pensions Order remains valid, but lays down, inter alia, that after that date payments will, at the employee’s request, be made by the Federal Labour Ministry and that the early-retirement pension shall be equal to 65% of the average net wage over the three preceding months.",0,640
1378,1378,"7. The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in the Moscow Region. 8. On 17 July 2002 the applicant privately sent a complaint to the deputy Governor of the Moscow Region. He reported on usurpation of a plot of communal land, adjacent to a public street in Iksha, by the private person Ms V. The applicant alleged that Ms A., the head of the Iksha town council, not only had failed to stand up for the rights of other Iksha residents but actively contributed to making the usurpation possible. In particular, Ms A. had allegedly brought about premature retirement of a land surveyor who had objected to the usurpation; she had interfered with the activities of court bailiffs who had come to reclaim the usurped land; she had assisted V. in obtaining title to the land by adverse possession; and she had ostensibly made an exemption for V. from regulations prohibiting planting of vegetables in the protected areas. The letter concluded as follows: “Such outrageous conduct of the appointed (not elected!) head of the town council vis-à-vis the town residents, – in full view of everyone – discredits the power that appointed A. and sets an example of breaking the law with impunity provided that you can 'make a deal' with the council head. I ask you to state your opinion on A.'s anti-social behaviour and assist [us] in returning the land plot into communal use, notwithstanding her opposition...” 9. On 27 September 2002 Ms A. lodged a civil action against the applicant for refutation of information damaging to her honour and dignity and compensation for non-pecuniary damage. She maintained that the applicant's letter had contained untrue facts and insulting value-judgments, which could have damaged her reputation in the eyes of her hierarchical superiors, thereby causing her non-pecuniary damage. 10. On 27 January 2003 the Dmitrov Town Court of the Moscow Region granted Ms A.'s defamation action, finding that the applicant had failed to prove the truthfulness of his allegations contained in the letter of 17 July 2002. Assessing the allegedly insulting value-judgments in the concluding paragraphs of the letter, the court held as follows: “In addition to failing to substantiate the said allegations with any proof, [the applicant] used expressions which, in their form and contents, are not appropriate in respect of an official, which the plaintiff is... Also, the court considers that the judgments used by the [applicant] in his letter – such as 'A. knows that by law protected areas may not be occupied, but ostensibly makes an exemption for V.', 'such outrageous conduct... discredits the power that appointed A. and sets an example of breaking the law with impunity provided that you can 'make a deal' with the council head', 'A.'s anti-social behaviour' – are not only untrue because the [applicant] failed to prove that these facts had occurred, but also insulting for the Town Council Head; this information, phrased as insults, damages dignity and honour of the plaintiff, and it was sent to a deputy Governor of the Moscow Region, which might have led to belittlement of the plaintiff's authority in the eyes of regional managers...” 11. The court bound the applicant to make a rectification by way of a letter to the deputy Governor of the Moscow Region and to pay 300 Russian roubles (EUR 10) to Ms A. for non-pecuniary damage. 12. The applicant lodged a statement of appeal, maintaining that his letter had stated his subjective view on the existing problem. 13. On 4 March 2003 the Moscow Regional Court partly upheld, on the applicant's appeal, the judgment of 27 January 2003. It did not analyse the truthfulness of the factual allegations and grounded its judgment on the three expressions quoted above in the last paragraph of the judgment of 27 January 2003. The appeal court struck down the obligation to send a rectification, but upheld the award in respect of non-pecuniary damage. 14. Article 29 guarantees freedom of ideas and expression. 15. Article 33 provides that Russian citizens shall have the right to petition in person, as well as to submit individual and collective appeals to, State authorities and local self-government bodies. 16. Article 152 provides that an individual may apply to a court with a request for the rectification of “statements” (“сведения”) that are damaging to his or her honour, dignity or professional reputation if the person who disseminated such statements does not prove their truthfulness. The aggrieved person may also claim compensation for losses and non-pecuniary damage sustained as a result of the dissemination of such statements. 17. Resolution no. 11 of the Plenary Supreme Court of 18 August 1992 “on certain issues that have arisen in the course of judicial examination of claims for the protection of honour and dignity of individuals, and professional reputation of individuals and legal entities” (as amended on 25 April 1995, in force at the material time) established that the notion “dissemination of information” employed in Article 152 of the Civil Code was understood as the publication of statements or their broadcasting, inclusion in professional references, public speeches, applications to State officials and communication in other forms, including oral, to at least one another person. It specified, however, that “communication of such information to the person whom it concerned could not be treated as dissemination”.",1,883
1379,1379,"5. The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Pruszcz Gdański. 6. On 8 June 2004 he was arrested by the police. 7. On 9 June 2004 the Gdańsk District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) decided to place the applicant in pre-trial detention as there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that he had been dealing in drugs. The court also cited the risk that the applicant would go into hiding, in view of the likelihood of a heavy sentence. 8. On 2 September and 4 November 2004 the applicant’s detention was extended. In addition to the two grounds given previously, the District Court cited the need to ensure the proper conduct of the investigation. 9. On 26 October 2004 the applicant was indicted before the Gdańsk District Court. His pre-trial detention was subsequently extended. 10. As the length of the applicant’s detention had reached the statutory timelimit of two years laid down in Article 263 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks postępowania karnego), the District Court made a series of applications to the Gdańsk Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) for the applicant’s detention to be extended beyond that term. On 18 May and 17 August 2006 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal granted the applications and extended his detention, citing the reasonable suspicion against the applicant and the length of the sentence that was likely to be imposed. The Court also considered that the District Court could not be held responsible for not having completed the trial as there had been objective procedural difficulties in hearing all the witnesses. 11. The first hearing was held on 21 January 2005. Subsequently, hearings were held at regular intervals. 12. The applicant’s applications for release from detention and his appeals against the decisions extending the preventive measure were dismissed. 13. On 17 October 2006 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention until 20 November 2006. It cited the reasonable suspicion against the applicant and found that detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings given the likelihood of a heavy sentence. 14. The applicant’s detention on remand was not extended beyond that date and on 20 November 2006 he was released. 15. On 4 August 2006 the applicant lodged a complaint under section 5 of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”). On 3 November 2006 the Gdańsk Regional Court dismissed the complaint, finding that the trial had been conducted speedily and with no periods of inactivity. 16. The proceedings are still pending before the trial court. 17. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning pre-trial detention (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its extension and release from detention, and the rules governing other “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) are set out in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Gołek v. Poland (no. 31330/02, §§ 27-33, 25 April 2006), and Celejewski v. Poland (no. 17584/04, §§ 22-23, 4 August 2006). 18. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings are stated in the Court’s decisions in the cases of Charzyński v. Poland (no. 15212/03 (dec.), §§ 1223, ECHR 2005-V), and Ratajczyk v. Poland (no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005VIII) and judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland (no. 61444/00, §§ 34-46, ECHR 2005-V).",1,575
